									<h3 class="major">Who Am I?</h3>
									<p>While all human stories start on the day that we are born and end on the day we die, it is most frequently the trials and tribulations of adulthood that define who we are as living beings. My story is no different. Yes, there were defining moment in my adolescence, but adulthood is where I truly discovered who I am. I am a writer, a poet, and an artist. I am an Air Force veteran, an administrative professional, and a web developer (in the making). And I am a philanthropist, wife and mother, and transgender lesbian woman.</p>

                                    <p>From a very young age I have been drawn to many of the creative arts. While I am always been drawn to literature, my first creative outlet was through music -- primarily the trombone (in high school and early college) and singing. Over the course of the last 20+ years I have also crafted numerous poems (some of which are published) and fictional stories (most of which are still in the works). These poems and some of my stories may be found within my creative portfolio. Since 2011 I have also been developing an interest and skill in hand-lettered calligraphy.</p>

									<h3 class="major">What I have accomplished.</h3>
									<p>With more that 20 years in the workforce, it is no stretch of the imagination to know that I have accomplished many things in that time. I have earned Associate degrees in both English and History from Solano Community College in Fairfield, CA, and a Bachelor degree in English with Honors in Creative Writing and a Minor in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies from the University of California in Davis, CA. I am also currently attending Lambda School to attain my endorsement in Full Stack Web Development. I am a veteran of the U.S. Air Force where I attained the rank of Staff Sergeant as a Loadmaster on the C-17A cargo aircraft (2002 - 2009). In 2015, I founded and operated a start-up non-profit organization called the Transgender Visibility & Education Network which serves to provide education and visibility both to and for the global transgender community. These are but a few of the many things I have accomplished as an ever-evolving adult.</p>
