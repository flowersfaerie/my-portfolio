									<h3 class="major">Once Upon A Time . . .</h3>
									<p>From the dawn of time, stories and storytelling have been an ever-present staple of human existence. In the beginning stories were used to tell the histories (or herstories, if you will) of a people, to communicate the rules and guidelines of a society, and even to explain the world around them by creating a pantheon of gods and goddesses (e.g., Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Norse, Native American, Indian, etc.).</p>

									<p>This pattern continued for thousands of years. Then, and it is hard to pinpoint exactly when it happened, a shift in style and subject matter occurred. Seemingly all of a sudden, the stories changed from history, science, and religion, into fictional stories which became a commentary of the societies and events of the writer's current world. This shift in storytelling gave birth to two disctinctive styles of writing within the fiction arena: literary fiction and genre fiction.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Literary fiction is defined as: "a story that tries to be bigger than the story itself. To do this, literary fiction must comment on something that is considered significant, such as social or political issues, or the human condition." -<a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/literary-fiction-definition-examples.html">(https://study.com/academy/lesson/literary-fiction-definition-examples.html)</a></li>
										<li>Genre fiction, on the other hand, is defined as: "refer[ing] to nonliterary works and include the categories of mystery, science fiction, fantasy, romance, western, and horror. Pure genre fiction is usually "one note" and works solely on the level it is intended. It does not necessarily have complex characters and is usually not character-driven, but plot-driven. Genre fiction tends to be written and read primarily for entertainment." -<a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/genre-fiction-definition-for-creative-writers-1277085">https://www.thebalancecareers.com/genre-fiction-definition-for-creative-writers-1277085</a></li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">A Fiction of My Own</h3>
									<p>My style of writing most closely fits within the genre fiction side of the arena. Within genre fiction there are numerous categories (e.g., horror, fantasy, romance, western, mystery, etc.) and I have discovered, over my years of crafting works of fiction, that I enjoy writing within several of these categorical genres. Currently, I have short stories and novels-in-progress that fit within the categories of romance, historical fantasy, science-fiction, horror, and thriller, among others. Captured within the links below, you will discover a sampling of some of the stories that I have written, including both completed (or mostly completed) short stories and extracts from novels length projects that are currently still in progress.</p>
