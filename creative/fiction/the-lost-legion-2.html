									<p>Grace Le Fay’s plans were progressing quite smoothly now. The girl was coming right to her and she knew that she would soon have all of the jewels in her possession. Her life long search was finally nearing an end. The years had been utter torture as she searched out the lost jewels. Even with only three of them currently in her possession, she knew that it would not be long before she had the rest of them.  This was especially true since she told Duncan the story of the crown and he had set off in search of it for his own interests. And soon the girl would be doing the same thing; both without their knowledge of who they were really working for.</p>

                                    <p>Having read the prophecy in the cave in Scotland, she had to admit that she was a little bit worried. But, after so many years, she had come to the conclusion that this other mysterious person would never materialize. Those jewels were rightly hers. Dionysus had no right scattering them like he did. Even though he had been betrayed, the crown was still rightfully hers. Now that the Greek pantheon had gone into permanent retirement – having been relegated to nothing more than myths and legends – she would finally reclaim her crown and her place among the ancient gods and goddesses of Olympus.</p>

                                    <p>The world would finally be hers.</p>

                                    <p>Lost in her thoughts, the knock on her door almost went unnoticed. It took her a moment before the second knock even registered. “Come in,” she said.</p>

                                    <p>Opening the heavy wooden door, the professor’s assistant, Amber Green, entered. “Mr. Forbes and a young lady are here to see you professor.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you, Amber. Please send them in.”</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, mum.” Stepping back out into the front office, she ushered Duncan and Avianna into the professor’s office.</p>

                                    <p>Duncan had already become accustomed over the years to the cold dark atmosphere of the office. Avianna, on the other hand, felt a sudden chill as soon she stepped inside, the door closing behind her. This was no ordinary chill as it seemed to come from deep within her instead of from the temperature of the room.  She had experienced several very chilly days while living by the San Francisco bay for most of her life, but this cold seemed to cut through to her very soul.  It was unlike anything she had ever felt before and she knew that not even the fire that was crackling in the fireplace would warm her.</p>

                                    <p>“Duncan!” Grace said, giving him a friendly hug.  “It is such a pleasure to see you again.  To what do I owe this honor?” To Avianna, the hug appeared to contain a lot more familiarity than she would have liked.</p>

                                    <p>“And who might this be?”</p>

                                    <p>“This, my dear Professor, is Miss Avianna Middleton.”</p>

                                    <p>“It is a pleasure to meet you Dr. Le Fay,” Avianna said quite cordially. “I think you might have known my aunt and my mother; Caitlyn Watson and Mhairi Middleton?”</p>

                                    <p>“Trust me, the pleasure is all mine.  And you can call me Grace,” said the professor. “Yes, I knew Caitlyn and Mhairi very well. But I haven’t heard from them in several years. How are they doing?”</p>

                                    <p>“My mother and father were killed in a car accident fourteen years ago and my aunt Caitlyn raised me until she passed away three months ago.”</p>

                                    <p>“I am so sorry to hear of your loss.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you.”</p>

                                    <p>“So, what brings you to see me today?”</p>

                                    <p>“Actually, I was hoping you could help me with some translations.  My mom told me you were really good with ancient languages and that I should come to you if I needed any help.”</p>

                                    <p>“As a favor to your mother and aunt, I would be honored.  Let me see what you have.”</p>

                                    <p>“Do you by chance have a copier that I could use to make some copies for you?” Avianna asked. “It would be much easier than working on the whole book.”</p>

                                    <p>“Certainly, my dear girl.” Picking up the phone, she called her assistant into the office. “Amber, will you please help Miss Middleton with some copies please.”</p>

                                    <p>“Of course professor.  Right this way Miss Middleton,” Amber said as she ushered Avianna back into the front office where the copier was located.</p>

                                    <p>“Duncan, I must say that I am very happy to see you again.  How is business these days?”</p>

                                    <p>“It is very steady and very profitable.  But, you know why I’m here.”</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, I do.  And I am afraid that I do not have any more information for you at this time as to the locations of the jewels we discussed.”</p>

                                    <p>“On the contrary.  I believe you will have some information very soon.”</p>

                                    <p>“I do think I understand your meaning, Duncan. Just what are you implying?” Grace asked.</p>

                                    <p>“Avianna has information about the jewels in that book of hers. The one she is copying right now,” Duncan said.  “I would be most appreciative if you could include me in the translation results.”</p>

                                    <p>“I see no harm in that. I’m curious, how did she come across this information?”</p>

                                    <p>“Maybe you should ask her yourself.  I don’t want to overstep my bounds with her.”</p>

                                    <p>Just then the door opened and Avianna came back into the office with the copies she had made for the professor to translate.  “Here you go professor, er, Grace. How long do you think it will take for you to translate these four languages?”</p>

                                    <p>“You seem to be in a hurry.”</p>

                                    <p>“I actually need to be in Scotland by Wednesday,” Avianna said.</p>

                                    <p>“Translations are never easy, you see, but I will do what I can about the time factor.  Three of these languages should be fairly easy as there are many resources from which to draw on. The Egyptian, Mayan, and Sanskrit languages are very well known.  But this fourth language may be a little more difficult. It looks somehow familiar, but it is a very obscure dialect that will take me some time to translate.  I should have these first three for you by morning and will continue on the fourth. after that.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you so much, Professor. I greatly appreciate your help. I need to be in Stonehaven Harbor by noon on Wednesday to take care of some family business. If at all possible, I need to have those translations before we leave London.”</p>

                                    <p>“No promises. But I will do my best,” Grace assured her. “Was there anything else I could help you with today?”</p>

                                    <p>“There is one thing, Professor,” Duncan said. “I tried to briefly explain the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur to Avianna on the flight over here. But, I’m afraid I probably kind of butchered it. Would you be willing to tell her the story of Theseus, the Minotaur, and Ariadne and Dionysus?”</p>

                                    <p>“If I didn’t have so much work to do, I would love to tell the story. How about this. Let me work on the translations tonight. Then tomorrow afternoon we can schedule a time and I will tell you the story the way it should be told.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you, Grace. I am really looking forward to hearing the story.”</p>

                                    <p>“Now if you will please forgive me. I obviously have some very time sensitive work that I must get started on.”</p>

                                    <p>“Of course. How might we contact you should the need arise?” Avianna asked.</p>

                                    <p>“Duncan has my phone number.  And if I need to get in touch with you, I will call him.  Am I assuming correctly that you will be together until then?”</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, she will be staying with me while we are in London.”</p>

                                    <p>“Good day then, Miss Middleton,” she said, forcing excitement into her voice.  “And a good day to you as well, Lord Forbes.”</p>

                                    <p>As if by pure chance, Duncan and Avianna both said in unison: “And a good day to you as well Professor Le Fay.” Avianna could not help but let a small giggle escape from within her at the unexpected timing of their farewells.  Gathering their things, they opened the door and exited the professor’s office leaving Grace to begin her work on the translations.</p>

                                    <p>As soon as they were gone, Grace shuddered as she realized her darkest fear. The second Seeker foretold of in the prophecy of the cave had finally arrived.  She too had felt the devastating cold that came over her when Avianna entered the room.  It was a cold that she would not soon forget. It almost felt like every morsel of her being had been frozen in a single instant, but she was still able to move. </p>

                                    <p>Looking at the pages Avianna had handed to her, she noticed that they were only partial page copies.  There was obviously something the girl was hiding from her.  Maybe something in the translations would bring light to the current mystery of the girl.  Sitting down at her desk again, she had one phone call she had to make before beginning her work on the translations.</p>

                                    <p>Dialing the number, the phone began to ring in her ear.  After a few seconds there was a click and a woman answered the phone.  “Hello?”</p>

                                    <p>“Several years ago I spared your life. It is now time for you to repay that debt.”</p>

                                    <p>“What must I do, Seeker?”  A strong taste of contempt echoed in her words.</p>

                                    <p>“There is something that I need you to do for me.  A man and a young woman were just in my office and they had something that I greatly desire.  I need you to bring that item to me.  I do not care how it is done, but this item needs to be in my hands before they leave for Scotland on Wednesday morning.”</p>

                                    <p>“Who are these people and where can I find them?” the woman asked.</p>

                                    <p>“The man is Lord Duncan Forbes, a wealthy Scottish businessman with offices in London.  The young woman you should already know very well…Avianna Middleton.”  A dark silence fell over the conversation for several long moments.  “If you do not feel up to this task, I do have other…let’s say…less pleasant ways of collecting upon the debt.”</p>

                                    <p>“No! No, I will do it,” the woman answered hesitantly. “What is it you need me to collect from them?”</p>

                                    <p>“The girl carries with her a book,” she said with a hint of greedy excitement in her voice, “that may hold the answers to my endless life.  The method is yours, but I must have that book.”</p>

                                    <p>“The debt will be repaid, Seeker.”  The woman struggled to hold back her tears as she thought back on the last time she had seen Avianna. Without another word she hung up the phone and set about completing the Seeker’s task.</p>

                                    <p>Setting her cell phone down on her desk, Grace began working on Avianna’s translations.  Knowing that she could easily translate the first three languages in only a few hours, she decided to focus her attention on the fourth language.  It was a language she had not seen even the remotest hint of in over three thousand years.  She had only seen this writing once before.  It was on a tablet of gold that Dionysus had very briefly stored for his father Zeus.  When she asked about it, he only said that it was the language of the gods and that she should forget she ever saw it.  Unable to curb her curiosity, she had made a clay copy of the tablet one night while he slept.</p>

                                    <p>Taking the paper copy with her, Grace quickly moved to the fireplace. Looking up she compared the writing on the paper to the clay tablet which was hanging above the mantle.</p>

                                    <p>They were the same language.</p>

                                    <p>The writing on the table had proven to be most difficult for her to translate.  It was wholly unlike any other language she had ever been exposed to.  Making a clay copy of the tablet was her first act of betrayal toward Dionysus and it certainly was not the last.  Keeping the copy hidden from him was not an easy task, but it was something she felt she had to do.  When she finally left him, she was able to begin work on translating the writing that had plagued her curiosity for so long.  It was not until the first millennium in the midst of the middle ages that she was at last able to discover the key to deciphering the text.</p>

                                    <p>The Fated two shall death decide until at last the colors of Olympus are reunited.<br>

                                    Lost in time, forgotten by man, what was created above, now scattered below.<br>

                                    Two daughters of heart contend for the prize of gods: a royalty lost, a scribe to come.<br>

                                    Hidden in shadows and separated by time, the rainbow to be decided by death.<br>

                                    The last revered in Olympus forever</p>

                                    <p>Stepping over to the high security filing cabinets, she quickly typed in the passcode which unlocked the drawer where she stored her most sacred and secret documents.  Within these files could be found her experiences in Greece during her marriage to Dionysus, her travels through ancient Egypt and Asia, the Americas before Columbus or the Vikings, through the now fabled histories of King Arthur and Guinevere, and her first encounter with the Mother Priestesses who guarded the box in the cave below Dunnottar Castle.  These were the legacy of the incredible life she had lived and the dark secret of numerous atrocities.</p>

                                    <p>Having translated many documents in her quest to reclaim the jewels, she knew just where to look for the original translation she had done for the clay tablet. Pulling out the thick file, she returned to her desk and carefully studied the documents within including the translation key she had created. </p>
