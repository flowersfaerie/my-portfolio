									<h3 class="major">The Departure</h3>
                                    <p>They’d had an argument the day before and now he couldn’t stop thinking about it.  No matter how many times James Jackson tried to think about other women, and there were thousands of former sexual partners to choose from, he could not her get out of his mind.  Even singing along to the radio didn’t help.</p>
                                    <p>After several hours of driving he reached his turnoff; a small one lane dirt road that served as his entrance into the wilderness.  Another hour’s drive down the dirt road brought him to a stopping point from which he still had a two-mile hike through the forest.  With an overloaded backpack and a fiberglass kayak lifted onto his shoulders, J.J. began his trek to the lake.  Up and down mountainsides and through thick forests, he navigated to his destination.</p>
                                    <p>During the hike, his last conversation with Carrina Hewitt, his best friend, continued to replay in his mind.  He had asked her out.  Yet again.  And she had refused him.  Yet again.  What had really thrown him for a loop was that she had told him how he could remedy the problem.</p>
                                    <p>Three hours later he summited a peak and there it was.  The lake.  He was now only another six hundred feet away from where he would spend the next three weeks in peaceful solitude.</p>
                                    <p>After setting up his campsite, he grabbed his fishing gear and paddled out to the center of the lake to do some fishing.  With his solar powered radio tuned to a local pop music station, he baited his hook and cast his line into the water.  For two hours he sat there catching fish and listening to music, but something had caught him as well.  On the radio came the silky voice of Kylie Minogue singing Aphrodite.  This wasn’t the first time he had heard the song, but one specific part hooked his attention.  Kylie sang “You know that I'm magical.  I am the original.  I am the only one to make you feel this way.  The moment that you kiss me you know that you'll miss me I am the only one.”  His thoughts once again returned to Carrina.  She was the only one he had ever truly desired and he longed for the day when he would be allowed to kiss her.  But, she was the only one he couldn’t have.</p>
                                    <p>As he paddled back to shore, he noticed some very unpleasant looking clouds starting to form over the lake.  Right where his campsite was.  The weather report he had gotten before he left home that morning had said there was a zero percent chance of rain for at least the next ten days.  He generally trusted the weather forecast while he was on his trips, but these clouds looked like they had plans of their own.</p> 
                                    <p>After dinner, as he sat there listening to the music of the forest, a very disturbing occurrence dripped onto his cheek.  It looked like the clouds had decided to follow through on their threat after all.  Dowsing the campfire, he grabbed what was left of his cocoa and went into his tent.  As soon as he had zipped it closed, the wind started to howl and the sky let loose with a spectacular fireworks display of thunder and lightning.</p>
                                    <p>As the wind blew harder and the rain fell sideways, he realized that sleeping in the tent would not be an option at all that night.  Rolling up his sleeping bag and stuffing it into his backpack he climbed out of his tent and made his way to a cave he had discovered during his hike in.</p>
                                    <p>His face stung as the rain pelted him from every direction.  The storm must have been directly overhead because there was no time delay between the lightning and the thunder.  Lightning was striking the ground in rapid fire patterns all around him.  How could the weatherman have missed this storm, he thought?</p>
                                    <p>When he reached the cave, he took off his pack and set it on the ground several yards inside to keep it dry.  Walking back to the mouth of the cave, he was momentarily blinded as a bolt of lightning struck a tree just ten feet from where he was standing.  He could feel the bolt’s heat and both hear and smell the wood sizzling as it burned.  His skin tingled with electricity.  Going back out there was definitely not an option.</p>
                                    <p>Unpacking his sleeping bag, he found a nice little spot to get some sleep for the night.  Aside from the recent excitement of the storm and the rush to get to the cave, he was pretty exhausted from the long day.  Closing his eyes, he decided he would explore the cave another day.</p>
                                    <p>Drifting off to sleep he dreamed of all of the women he had seduced over the years.  Blondes, brunettes, redheads.  Whites, blacks, Latinas, Asians.  The variations of women seemed almost unending.  Never once had he slept with the same woman a second time and some of them he had slept with at the same times.  His life had been one long wet dream.  But, somehow, this dream still managed to return to his one enduring fantasy woman.</p>
                                    <p>Carrina.</p>
                                    <p>Instead of dreaming about seducing her, he dreamed about falling in love with her.  His unconscious mind envisioned living a long life with her by his side: getting married, having kids, grandkids, even great-grandkids.  He was in love with her even if his conscious mind was unwilling to admit it.</p>
 
                                    <h3 class="major">Into the Darkness</h3>
                                    <p>Early the next morning J.J. was awakened by a violent crash of thunder and lightning.  The heady aroma of charred wood filled his nostrils.  Looking outside he saw that the rain was still falling pretty hard.  All of this rain and lightning made it impossible to go out and enjoy the forest and the lake.  He decided that while he was trapped in the cave he might as well do some spelunking and explore its hidden mysteries.</p>
                                    <p>Having gone caving before, he had come on this trip semi-prepared.  With the exception of a helmet, he pulled all of the gear he would need out of his backpack along with several granola bars and his half-full canteen.  Looking outside one last time, he turned and pressed forward into the darkness.</p>
                                    <p>Step by careful step he made his way through the cave’s labyrinthine twists and turns.  As bright as his lantern was, it still barely illuminated the path before him.  The darkness seemed to ooze from the walls.  Having traveled more than half a mile into the cave system, he prayed that he would be able to find his way out again when he was done exploring.  After pushing through several squeezes, traversing up and down a few steep dips, and leaping across a couple of pits, he looked at his watch and saw that he had been underground for more than five hours already.</p>
                                    <p>Sitting down on a nearby boulder, he set his lantern on the ground beside him.  It wasn’t until the lantern began to slide away from him that he realized how close he was to a cliff’s edge.  While snacking on a granola bar he shone his flashlight all around him.  Not seeing any continuation to the path beyond the canyon, he soon understood that he would either have to turn back in defeat or climb down the cliff face into the light gobbling blackness.</p>
                                    <p>He didn’t know why, but he felt like something was calling to him and he chose to press forward into the unknown.</p>
                                    <p>As he readied his gear for the descent, he began to think about what Carrina would say if she knew what he was doing.  He knew that she was very protective of him almost like a step-mom or a big sister – or a wife, but he usually just pushed that thought aside and continued what he was doing.  This time, he made sure to check everything two and three times just to appease his thoughts about her protectiveness.</p>
                                    <p>Flashlight in hand, he peered over the edge hoping the drop was not too deep and quickly found that the beam was not going to reach the bottom.  Cracking two glowsticks into life, he strategically dropped them over the edge to see how far they fell.  He was elated to see that they landed about ten feet away from each other and only about sixty feet down.  He had more than enough rope to get down there.</p>
                                    <p>Having finished his granola bar and rehydrated from his canteen, he prepared for his descent.  Slipping into his climbing harness and tightening the straps he anchored the rope to the boulder he had just been sitting on.  Carefully lowering himself over the edge, he began repelling down the short distance.  Even with his lantern strapped to his harness and his head lamp illuminating the way, the darkness continued to feel very oppressive.  Down he went being very careful not to miss a foothold.  In less than ten minutes he had reached the bottom of the cliff right between the two glowsticks.</p>
                                    <p>Unclipping the lantern from his harness, he looked around and discovered that his travel options were limited.  Only one way to go.  Less than five hundred yards along the path he came to a dead end.  There was nowhere left for him to go.  The walls were too smooth to climb without a rope and he had used all of that just getting down here.  J.J. sat down and leaned against the dead end wall feeling defeated.</p>
                                    <p>As he sat there in the silent darkness he cursed the probability of his defeated return to the surface.  He was unaccustomed to defeat.  In the stillness of the cave he began to hear what sounded like water dripping into a pool.  It was coming from behind him.  But how could that be possible, he thought.  This is solid rock.  Shining his flashlight all along the wall he had just been leaning against, he found it.  Another passage.  A way forward.  Thirty feet above him was a small opening that might be just big enough for him to squeeze through.  Now the question was, how was he going to reach it?</p>
                                    <p>Scanning the wall beneath the passageway one more time, he found what he was hoping for.  An inch wide cleft that traveled all the way up past the opening.  The challenge; it was six feet to the right of the opening.  Also, he did not have any chalk powder for his hands nor was he wearing the right shoes for climbing.  But, as it was a short climb, he decided to go for it anyway.</p>
                                    <p>Squeezing four fingers of each hand into the cleft, he began his ascent.  His boots had a hard time getting a grip on the smooth rock wall, but, slowly, he made his way up.  By the time he reached the thirty foot mark his fingers were screaming with pain.</p>
                                    <p>Looking to his left he saw that the opening was nearly within reach.  Carefully removing his left hand from its gripping point in the cleft, he reached out trying to get to the opening.  He could just reach the corner of the passage, but the rock was too slick for him to get a good grip.  Pointing his head lamp toward the opening, he saw near the center a small lip that might work as a hand hold.  If he could reach it.</p>
                                    <p>Gathering his remaining strength, he released his tenuous grip on the cleft and leaped toward the opening.  Arms outstretched.  The short leap seemed to go in slow motion as he flew through the air.  His tired and aching fingers preparing to grasp the small lip.  Just as he thought he was going to miss his chance and fall thirty feet back to the path below, his fingers found their mark and gripped the lip.  Using the last of his dwindling strength, he pulled himself up into the passage.  He had to unclip his lantern and push it in ahead of himself; otherwise he would not have fit.  He soon realized that he was going to have to inch himself along to the end as there was no room for any big pushing or pulling movements, much less deep breaths.</p>
                                    <p>Inch by tortuous inch, J.J. made his way through the passage.  His energy dwindling fast, he began to think about Carrina again.  In his exhaustion he began to picture himself entombed within this passage, never being able to see her again and tell her how much he loved her.  I have to make it out of here.</p>
                                    <p>Thirty minutes later, and completely exhausted, he reached the other end of the passage.  Pulling himself out of the stone birthing canal he leaned against the wall opposite the opening and tried to regain some of his flagging strength.  Maybe, once he regained his strength, he would be able to find the source of the dripping water and refill his nearly empty canteen.</p>
                                    <p>As he sat there snacking on his granola bar and drinking the remainder of his small water supply he began to hear it again.  The dripping water.  It was much louder now and sounded like it was very close.</p>
                                    <p>Looking in the direction of the dripping sound he noticed something odd on the cave wall.  A faint rippling shimmer.  But where was the light coming from?</p>
                                    <p>Standing, he walked toward the shimmer.  It was a very short walk.  Turning a rounded corner, he was awed by what he found.  A massive cavern spread out before him.  At the center of the cavern was a glowing crystal clear lake.  This glow made his use of a lantern look like a flea holding a candle up to the sun.</p>
                                    <p>As he made his way down from his perch above the lake, the path became easier as steps had been carved out of the rock.  With each step his awe and wonder grew.  The beauty of the crystal clear water.  The majesty of the regal rock formations.  Then there was the golden statue at the center of the lake.</p>
                                    <p>Standing by the side of the lake, he gazed upon the statue.  It was about twenty feet tall and made of solid gold.  The subject of the statue was a woman whose physical beauty would have shamed even the most beautiful of supermodels.</p>
                                    <p>The statue somehow reminded him of Carrina.  Her beauty had stolen his heart even from their first meeting.  Her dark chocolate brown hair which hung in loose curls over her narrow shoulders.  Her emerald green eyes which shimmered with the golden flakes that highlighted them.  Her sensual lips, often painted a deep crimson, always smiling.  Her graceful neck and shoulders, her perfect grapefruit sized breasts, her naturally thin waist and rounded hips and butt, and finally her long slim legs that seemed to go on for miles.  All of these attributes culminated in the incredible beauty that was Carrina Hewitt.</p>
                                    <p>But this statue overshadowed even her.</p>
                                    <p>In her outstretched hands, the statue carried a simple pitcher from which dripped the diamond teardrops that had pooled to form this vast underground lake.  Underneath the golden woman was a brightly jeweled golden pedestal upon which she stood forever frozen.  Etched into the pedestal were characters, probably words, but he would have to get a lot closer before he would be able to read them.</p>
                                    <p>Time for a refreshing swim.</p>
                                    <p>Since he was all alone in this subterranean paradise, he had no problem stripping down to nothing for his swim out on the lake.  Piling his clothes near the shore, he dove into the water.  Surprisingly, the water was actually quite warm and he felt a strange tingling in his skin as he swam.</p>
                                    <p>When he had reached the small island at the center, he climbed out of the water and began examining the golden woman and the pedestal upon which she stood.  Seeing the woman’s face this close up, he noticed an uncanny resemblance to Carrina.  He had to be hallucinating.  There is no way this could be Carrina, he thought.  Why would there be a golden statue of Carrina in the middle of this underground lake?</p>
                                    <p>Pushing the thought aside, he stepped back and looked at the statue as a whole.  But, it was the writing on the pedestal that intrigued him.  It was not Latin, but rather a very old form of ancient Greek.  He had not studied the language at all so he gave up on translating it, but he did recognize some of the characters as Greek.  My college fraternity had been good for something after all, he thought.  He was still very curious about what it said though.</p>
                                    <p>Knowing that he had the next three weeks in which to study the statue and the cave, he decided that it was about time for him to head back to camp.  Tilting his head back under the golden pitcher, he let several drops of water plunge into his mouth before he swallowed.  From the very first drop he knew there was something special about this water.  Not only was it as sweet as honey straight from the honeycomb, but it had a certain essence about it that infused him with energy from head to toe.</p>
                                    <p>Diving back into the water, he swam back to his pile of clothes on the shore.  Before leaving the cavern he refilled and emptied his canteen twice over.  Finally sated, he dressed and worked his way back out of the cave.</p>
                                    <p>When he reached the mouth of the cave, he saw that it had stopped raining and the clouds had dispersed.  Recovering his gear he returned to his campsite.  With the exception of the days he had to go fishing to keep himself fed, he spent every day at the underground lake.  From that very first taste, he no longer drank anything but the water from the lake.  He spent hours gazing at the gorgeous golden woman as he swam naked in the warm tingling waters of the glowing lake.  He thought about Carrina every time he looked at the statue’s face.  He couldn’t wait to get home to tell her all about it.</p>
                                    <p>By the end of the second week he had begun to notice a general achiness all over his body.  When he packed up his gear at the end of the third week, he knew something was wrong.  He barely had enough strength to carry his backpack through the forest, let alone the kayak too.  So, he left the kayak behind and secured it to a tree for when he returned someday.  By the time he had driven home, he felt completely exhausted and his body hurt everywhere.  </p>
 
                                    <h3 class="major">The Light at the End</h3>
                                    <p>As it was still early in the evening, J.J. took a couple of Advil and called Carrina.  For three weeks she was all that he thought about.  Even when he didn’t want to think about anything.  He still couldn’t believe how incredible the likeness was between her and the statue.  It was uncanny.</p>
                                    <p>Dialing the phone he waited while the phone rang.</p>
                                    <p>“Hi, Jacob.  What’s up?” she said, happy to hear his voice.</p>
                                    <p>“I just got home from my trip and wanted to see if you would be interested in coming over to hang out for a little while. You can help me eat some of this fish I have left over.”</p>
                                    <p>“That sounds great.  I just got home from work and I haven’t eaten all day.”</p>
                                    <p>“Perfect.  So, I’ll see you in a few minutes?”</p>
                                    <p>“I was just about to hop in the shower, but I guess it can wait.  Let me just change into something more comfortable and I’ll be right over.”</p>
                                    <p>When he heard her say that he immediately pictured her changing into some sexy lingerie and had to laugh.</p>
                                    <p>“What are you laughing at?”  He hadn’t realized he had actually laughed out loud.</p>
                                    <p>“Oh, nothing.  Just remembering a joke I heard on the radio,” he lied.  “When you get here just come on in.  I’ll leave the door unlocked.  And don’t take too long, ‘cause I’m starving.”  After they hung up, he went upstairs and unpacked his backpack while he waited for his special delivery.</p>
                                    <p>After tossing all of the dirty sweaty clothes into the hamper, he began unloading the gear and leftover food that had not been consumed during his trip.  The last thing he pulled from his now empty pack was his canteen.  Still half-full, he thought.  Unscrewing the cap, he took a quick gulp of the honey-sweet water.  It felt cool as it passed over his parched lips and he relished the familiar tingling as it traveled down his throat.</p>
                                    <p>The tingling.</p>
                                    <p>He had to let Carrina try some of this water.  Pulling the canteen from his lips, he screwed the cap back on and set it down on the dresser while he stowed the backpack in the closet.</p>
                                    <p>“Hello?  Jacob?” Carrina called from downstairs.</p>
                                    <p>“I’m in the bedroom.  I’ll be down in just a minute.  Make yourself at home.”</p>
                                    <p>Even with the Advil starting to take effect, his body still ached everywhere.  I should probably go see the doctor tomorrow and get checked out, he thought.  Something is definitely not right with me.</p>
                                    <p>“Hey, beautiful,” he said as he walked into the living room.</p>
                                    <p>“Hi, yourself,” she said as she stood up and gave him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek.  “So, how was your big vacation in the mountains?”</p>
                                    <p>“It was great, if you don’t include the nasty thunderstorm that poured rain and lightning all over the mountains the first two days.”</p>
                                    <p>“Rain and lightning, huh?”  She had a look on her face that signaled that she knew something, but he didn’t notice it.  “I was keeping track of the weather the entire time and there wasn’t a single cloud anywhere near those mountains.  Let alone the entire state.”</p>
                                    <p>“Well, the smoldering trees might argue with you,” he joked.  “So, how come you never told me you kept a weather log of my trips?”  A cheesy grin formed between his cheeks.</p>
                                    <p>“Because, I figured you would think I was some kind of obsessed nut or something.”</p>
                                    <p>He just looked at her and didn’t say anything.</p>
                                    <p>“I was right, wasn’t I?  You do think I’m a nut, don’t you?”  She sat back into the couch, her hands coming up to cover the blossoming rouge in her cheeks.</p>
                                    <p>Sitting down beside her, he put his arm around her shoulders and hugged her to him.  “Actually,” he said, “I think it’s kind of sweet that a nut like you would watch over me like that.”</p>
                                    <p>“Well, don’t go getting a swelled head over it,” she said, playfully pushing him away.  “I just care about your safety is all.”</p>
                                    <p>“Okay, okay.  No sense getting yourself all hot and bothered over it.”  Just then a loud gurgle churned in his stomach, changing the subject for them.  “What do you say we cook up some of that fish and I’ll tell you all about my trip?”  As they ate, he regaled her with his story.  Knowing he could trust her with anything, he even told her about the cave and the statue.</p>
                                    <p>“So, what did the statue look like?” she asked.</p>
                                    <p>“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”</p>
                                    <p>“Try me.  You might be surprised.”</p>
                                    <p>“Promise you won’t laugh?”</p>
                                    <p>“I promise.”  With her right hand she crossed her heart.</p>
                                    <p>“When I saw the statue up close, the first thing I thought of was…”  He hesitated for a moment as he tried to figure out how he would say what he was thinking. </p>
                                    <p>“Was what?” she prompted.  “What did you think of?”</p>
                                    <p>Timidly, he began again.  “The first thing I thought of was you.”  He took a big swallow of wine before he continued.  “I mean, this statue looked exactly like you.  Pretty crazy, right?”</p>
                                    <p>With an innocent glimmer in her eyes she said, “That’s honestly the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.  You seem different than when you left.”</p>
                                    <p>“You have no idea,” he quipped.  “Every day for the last three weeks, you were all I could think about.  Now who sounds like the obsessed nut?”</p>
                                    <p>“Jacob, I hope you aren’t saying this just to get into my panties,” she said with a touch of mistrust.  “Because if you are, tell me now.  I don’t want to wake up in the morning with nothing but a walk of shame to look forward to.”</p>
                                    <p>“No, Carrina.  It’s nothing like that,” he said.  “I really do care about you.  As much as I love you, I don’t want to just jump in bed with you.”  And he meant it, too.  “Would you believe grandkids came up quite frequently during those three weeks as I thought about you?”</p>
                                    <p>“In some strange way I think I actually do believe you, Jacob.  You really have changed.  But, just so you know, I can’t marry you.  Not now.”</p>
                                    <p>“I wasn’t actually proposing, but why not?  Why don’t you want to marry me?”</p>
                                    <p>“Let me ask you something.”</p>
                                    <p>“Shoot.”</p>
                                    <p>“Did you drink the water from the underground lake?”</p>
                                    <p>Just then a pain shot through his body like a bolt of lightning.  It was so sudden and so intense that he crumpled to the floor in agony.  Carrina quickly knelt on the floor beside him and cradled his head in her lap trying to comfort him.</p>
                                    <p>“You did drink it, didn’t you?”  The only thing he could do was nod.</p>
                                    <p>Once the pain had subsided somewhat, he looked up into her sparkling emerald eyes with an agonized look on his face.  “What’s happening to me, Carrina?  What aren’t you telling me?”  The way that she’d asked about the water suggested to him that she knew something about it.</p>
                                    <p>“You’ll find out soon enough.  But, for now, let’s get you up into bed.  You’re going to need your rest.”</p>
                                    <p>He couldn’t argue with her as she led him up the stairs to his bedroom, one painful step at a time.  He said nothing as she undressed him and gently laid him down in his bed.  As he plummeted into sleep, she laid down next to him – on top of the sheets – and gently stroked his sweat soaked hair, occasionally wiping the pained tears that streamed from the corners of his eyes.  In the last seconds before sleep and unconsciousness took him, he heard her whisper a solemn prayer.</p>
                                    <p>“Please goddess.  Be gentle with him.”</p>
                                    <hr>
                                    <p>When J.J. opened his eyes the next morning, Carrina was gone.  The pain of the previous night was gone as well, for the time being.  As he laid there wiping the crusty sleep from his eyes he felt as if he were somehow smaller in his king sized bed.  Pulling the covers back and sitting up, he noticed something else as well.  He felt lighter too.</p>
                                    <p>Standing up, still feeling a little stiff and achy, he walked into the bathroom.  While waiting for the shower to warm up he looked at himself in the mirror.  He had spent a great deal of time over the years cultivating a finely tuned body.  The body he looked at now was still finely tuned, but it was not the body he recognized as his own.</p>
                                    <p>Overnight, his body had morphed into something new.  Gone were the bulging arms, shoulders, and chest.  Gone were the toned muscles in his thighs and calves.  Gone were the chiseled jaw line and ruggedly handsome facial structure.  Looking at his face a little closer in the mirror, he ran a hand from cheek to cheek and noticed that any facial hair he normally would have had to shave off was completely non-existent.  Looking down, so was the rest of his body hair.</p>
                                    <p>He had always had a strong and trim mid-section, but what he saw in the mirror shocked him.  The waistline he had now, while still tightly muscled, was impossibly small and rounded out into what could only be described as womanly hips.  Looking further down, he saw that his once proud manhood was still there, but even it had been reduced in stature.</p>
                                    <p>“What kind of nightmare is this?  Why can’t I wake up out of this wretched dream?” he screamed at his reflection.  He was definitely changing alright.</p>
                                    <p>Into a woman.</p>
                                    <p>After a quick shower, he selected a suit from his closet to wear to work.  He really noticed the changes in his body when none of his clothes fit right.  The tailored shirt was too loose everywhere.  He was literally swimming in the jacket.  And the pants were the worst; way too big in the waist and unusually tight in the hips and ass.  How much more could my body possibly change, he thought?</p>
                                    <p>Once he finished his usual breakfast of yogurt and a grapefruit, he went to work.  He knew Carrina wouldn’t have spent the night, but all day long he kept thinking about her question about the water.  Every chance he got, he tried calling her to ask her what she knew.  Each time he got the same response.  No answer.  If he didn’t know any better, he would have sworn that she was trying to avoid him.</p>
                                    <p>Over the course of the next week he called and left dozens of messages for Carrina.  But, never once did she call him back.  He even went over to her Park Avenue apartment several times and each time it was the same story.</p>
                                    <p>Nobody home.</p>
                                    <p>During that time his body continued to change.  His voice rose in pitch several octaves.  His hair continued to grow at an amazing speed and was already down past his shoulders.  In one week his breasts had grown to a size that would have taken any natural woman years to develop.  But the most emotionally painful change for him was the complete loss of his manhood.  By the end of the week it had inverted inside of him and become a functional vagina.</p>
                                    <p>The metamorphosis was complete and everyone at work had begun to make jokes and talk behind his back.  He knew he would have to change jobs soon or risk continued harassment.  At the end of the week he tried calling Carrina one more time.  He was about to give up on her.  Dialing her number one last time he waited impatiently.</p>
                                    <p>One ring…</p>
                                    <p>Two rings…</p>
                                    <p>Three rings…</p>
                                    <p>Just before he was about to give up on her, she answered.  “Hello?”</p>
                                    <p>“Where have you been?  I’ve been trying to call you all week.”</p>
                                    <p>“Who is this?”  Carrina did not recognize the phone number on the Caller ID nor did she recognize the woman’s voice on the other end of the line.  J.J. no longer had a man’s voice so she decided to use this to her advantage.</p>
                                    <p>“You need to come over to Jacob’s house immediately!”</p>
                                    <p>“What’s wrong with Jacob?”</p>
                                    <p>“Just come.  I can’t say over the phone, but he really needs you right now.  He keeps calling out for you.”  In her anguish and pain she had called out for her many times.  She was almost glad that Carrina did not know that it was him on the phone.</p>
                                    <p>“I’ll be right over.  Just tell him to hang on.”  She knew that, traffic allowing, Carrina would get there within the hour.  She had to plan this meeting out carefully.</p>
                                    <p>The knock on the door came much quicker than she had expected.  As the door was opened Carrina said, “Where’s Jacob?  Is he alright?  I got here as fast as I could.”  She was frantic with worry.</p>
                                    <p>“He’s fine.  He’ll be out in just a minute.  Can I get you something to drink?  Coffee? Or tea perhaps?”</p>
                                    <p>“No, thank you.  Where’s Jacob?  On the phone you made it seem urgent that I get here fast, like he was dying or something.”</p>
                                    <p>“Did I really?” J.J. said, a tiny hint of sarcasm in her voice.  “I’m sorry that I worried you.  But you’re really not far off from the truth.”</p>
                                    <p>“What do you mean?  Where’s Jacob?” Carrina said, anger becoming evident on her face.</p>
                                    <p>The young woman held her arms out from her sides, her palms facing up.  “He’s right here.”</p>
                                    <p>“I don’t understand.”  </p>
                                    <p>“Perhaps I should introduce myself.  My name is Jessica Jackson.  But you can call me J.J., if you like.”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Jessica.  Are you Jacob’s cousin?” Carrina said, a knowing smile on her face.  “Jacob, you get your ass out here right now!” she called out to the house.</p>
                                    <p>“I’m not his cousin and you’re looking at him.  I’m him Carrina.  Or rather, I’m her.  I went camping in the mountains for three weeks and now I look like this.”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s amazing that it happened so fast.”</p>
                                    <p>“What do you mean, Carrina?  What haven’t you been telling me?” Jessica demanded.</p>
                                    <p>“I guess I can’t hide the truth any longer.  It’s time I told you everything.”</p>
                                    <p>“Told me what?  What aren’t you telling me about what’s happing to me?”</p>
                                    <p>“You’ve been blessed Jac…uh, Jessica.”</p>
                                    <p>“What do you mean ‘blessed’?  From where I’m sitting, this feels more like a curse.”  She was getting angry.</p>
                                    <p>“In a way, that is true.  It’s a punishment for your sins.  But it’s also a blessing.”</p>
                                    <p>“Tell me!  How is this a blessing, Carrina?”  Jessica was growing more and more angry by the second.  “And what do you mean a punishment for my sins?  I’ve always lived a good clean life.”</p>
                                    <p>“If you had bothered to read the inscription on the pedestal below the statue…”</p>
                                    <p>“How could I read it?” Jessica interrupted.  “It was in ancient Greek?”</p>
                                    <p>“I’m sorry.  I guess it’s a little too late for semantics now,” Carrina began.  “It said: ‘He who drinks of the essence of Aphrodite confesses his sin.  By willingly drinking he shall become that which he has wrongfully taken from others.  Until such time as he has found forgiveness for his sins his change shall be unchangeable.’”</p>
                                    <p>“What does that even mean?  It sounds like just a bunch of legalese to me.  And how would you know what it said?”</p>
                                    <p>“Because I read it with my dad fifteen years ago.”</p>
                                    <p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
                                    <p>“My real name is Charles Hewitt and I was changed for my sins.  I was responsible for my mother’s death.”</p>
                                    <p>“What do you mean?  Your mom’s not dead.  I saw her just last year at Christmas.”</p>
                                    <p>“When I was fourteen, my mom and dad had had a lot to drink at their anniversary party so I was forced to drive us home.  During the drive home, my dad and I got into a pretty heated argument about something stupid.  Not watching where I was going I drifted into oncoming traffic and we got into an accident.  My dad and I were saved by the air bags, but my mom, who wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, was thrown through the front window and killed.  After she passed away, my dad and I went on a camping trip together to remember her; she always loved camping.  The first night it rained really badly and we were chased into that same cave by the very same lightning that chased you in there.  The very same storm that didn’t show up on any weather radar.  When we found the cavern and the statue in the lake we were amazed.  We swam out to it and studied it just like you did.  When we saw the writing on the pedestal, my dad translated it for me.  He, being a Classical Studies professor at Harvard, was able to read the Greek.”</p>
                                    <p>“Then what happened?” Jessica asked.</p>
                                    <p>“Ignoring the warning, we both drank the sweet nectar of Aphrodite.  She changed both of us.  He became the very likeness of my mother and me, as a teenager, I became a younger version of her.  I see it as Aphrodite’s blessing that we be allowed to keep her memory alive.”</p>
                                    <p>“I’m so sorry, Carrina.  That must have been horrible for you.”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s alright.  It was a long time ago.”</p>
                                    <p>“So, what does any of that have to do with me being punished?”</p>
                                    <p>“All of those women that you slept with and cast aside.  Did you ever stop and consider what you were taking from them?  What they could never get back?”</p>
                                    <p>“No, I guess I never really thought about it.”</p>
                                    <p>“That is your blessing, Sweetie.  You have been given the opportunity to see life through their eyes.  The chance to seek their forgiveness.”</p>
                                    <p>“I think I’ve been cursed instead.”</p>
                                    <p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
                                    <p>“There’ve been more than a few hundred different women.  How am I ever going to find them all?”</p>
                                    <p>“Well, at least you have the chance.  My mom is dead. I can never get that forgiveness.”</p>
                                    <p>“I guess we’re both screwed then.  I know that at least two of them were killed in a car accident a couple of years ago.”  They both cried, hugging each other as newly found sisters and daughters of Aphrodite.</p>
