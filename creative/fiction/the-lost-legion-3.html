									<p>Their week of passion finally came to a painful end.  The night before the sacrifices she was not allowed in to see Theseus.  She cried the tears of a great anguish at the thought of never seeing him again after he entered the labyrinth.  All night she was plagued with the thoughts of how she would spend the rest of her life alone in the palace of Knossos.</p>

                                    <p>When morning came she was sorely exhausted, having been up all night crying and worrying.  She longed to see him again and hold him in her arms.  To kiss his gentle lips and to feel his body pressed against hers.</p>

                                    <p>As she dressed for the day, dreaming about Theseus, there came a soft knocking on her door.  She walked to the door thinking it was probably one of her father’s advisors coming to tell her that it was time to begin the sacrifice of the Athenians to the Minotaur.  Opening the door, she was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not an advisor after all.</p>

                                    <p>“Daedalus,” Ariadne said.  “I am so happy you came.  Please come in.”</p>

                                    <p>“I dare not, Princess.  I merely came to give you something before I leave.”</p>

                                    <p>“Leave?  Where are you going my old friend?”</p>

                                    <p>“I’m taking Icarus and we are leaving Crete before I lose my life here.”</p>

                                    <p>“But why would you lose your life?”</p>

                                    <p>“Because of these.”  He drew a glistening and obviously sharp sword from his robes as well as a simple ball of twine.</p>

                                    <p>“What are these for?”</p>

                                    <p>“The sword is for killing your half-brother and the twine is so that your Prince may find his way out of the labyrinth.  Provided he survives the first part, that is.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you so much, Daedalus,” she said, throwing her arms around his neck and hugging him in appreciation.  “But where will you go?  You know that my father will never let you leave.”</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, I know your father all too well.  He will probably have every port watched.  But, I have no intention of leaving by ship.”</p>

                                    <p>“What do you mean?  What other way is there, if not by ship?”</p>

                                    <p>“I’m afraid that knowledge can be neither given nor earned.  I must take it to my grave with me.  I am sorry, Ariadne, but I really must go.  I have already stayed much longer than I had planned.”</p>

                                    <p>“I will miss you, my dear old friend,” she said.  A sadness filling her voice.</p>

                                    <p>“And I you, Highness.  Try not to get yourself into too much trouble in my absence,” Daedalus said.</p>

                                    <p>“I’ll try.  Goodbye my old friend and may the gods give you wings of swiftness to carry you safely to your destination.”</p>

                                    <p>“From your lips to the gods ears.” With a gentle kiss on her brow he turned and left her room never to be seen again.  </p>

                                    <p>The sword and twine in hand, she quickly raced to Theseus’ bed chamber, but by the time she got there he was already gone.  The Athenians must have already been taken down to the labyrinth.</p>

                                    <p>Hiding the sword and twine in her robes, she made her way to the labyrinth.  When she got there she discovered that the ceremony had already begun without her. Unlike previous tributes, her father was going to sacrifice all fourteen of the Athenians at the same time.  She had to hurry as they were already being ushered through the gate.</p>

                                    <p>“Theseus!” she called.  “Theseus, wait!”</p>

                                    <p>Turning, he stopped and waited for her.  She ran up to him and threw her arms around him, hugging him against her breast.</p>

                                    <p>“I missed you last night, my love,” said Theseus.</p>

                                    <p>“And I was absolutely miserable without you beside me.”</p>

                                    <p>“Keep it moving Athenian,” growled a nearby guard.</p>

                                    <p>“Here, Theseus. Take these,” she said, handing him the sword and twine. “My friend Daedalus, who built this labyrinth, gave me these to give to you.  He said it was the only way he could help us.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you, sweet Ariadne.  And may the gods bless our friend Daedalus.”</p>

                                    <p>“I know she’s gorgeous, Athenian.  But you already have a date with the Minotaur,” said the guard, laughing at Theseus.</p>

                                    <p>“Watch for my return, Princess.  I will come for you.  I love you.” He kissed her tenderly on the lips and then was forcibly ushered through the labyrinth’s gate.</p>

                                    <p>The brief encounter with Theseus left her feeling even more alone and fearful than before.  Now that he was actually inside the labyrinth she feared that she would never see him again.</p>

                                    <hr>

                                    <p>For three days Ariadne kept an ever vigilant watch for Theseus’ return. She seldom allowed herself any sleep and the rare sleep she did get was filled with nightmares.  Visions of the future and the mysterious girl holding the box. On the third night her body finally betrayed her and she fell into a deep sleep.  The visions came almost at once.</p>

                                    <p>A rocky beach.  The ocean waves crashing against the cliff that towered high above them.  Heavy snows fell sideways in the blizzard that raged.</p>

                                    <p>She began to climb. The destination was a small cave in the side of the cliff high above the thrashing waves.  Stepping into the cave she became aware of an other-worldly glow that did not flicker as a flame would.  Each carefully placed step into the cave brought a new meaning to the cold dampness that seemed to ooze out of the walls of stone that surrounded her. The glow seemed to intensify the closer she got.</p>

                                    <p>Turning a sharp corner in the dark passageway she stood before an elaborately sculpted stone archway. The engraved writing on the archway was wholly unfamiliar to her, but she had seen the knotted interlacing before. It was on the box in her previous visions.</p>

                                    <p>Walking through the archway she moved into a very small cavern.  On the far side of the cavern was the box from her earlier visions.  And it appeared to be the source of the ethereal glowing.  The box sat on an ornately carved stone pedestal. Behind the pedestal, carved into the wall was an inscription.  The language was one she had never seen before, but somehow she instantly knew what it said.</p>

                                    <p style="font-style:italic">The Fated two shall death decide until at last the colors of Olympus are reunited.<br>

                                    Lost in time, forgotten by man, what was created above, now scattered below.<br>

                                    Two daughters of heart contend for the prize of gods: a royalty lost, a scribe to come.<br>

                                    Hidden in shadows and separated by time, the rainbow to be decided by death.<br>

                                    The last revered in Olympus forever</p>

                                    <p>She had no idea what the inscription meant but it made her very afraid as it obviously had something to do with her.</p>

                                    <p>Taking a couple of steps closer to the pedestal she was surprised and scared when all of the torches in the room suddenly ignited, bringing a warm light to the room.  This room was actually designed as an altar chamber. She was amazed at how pristinely clean the chamber was.  There were no insects or spider webs as was common in caves on Crete.  All of the walls were smooth and undamaged by roots or condensation.  The cave was all free of any signs of dust which would have littered any cave on the planet.  It almost appeared as if the cave had been meticulously maintained in expectation of her arrival.</p>

                                    <p>Stepping up to the pedestal she carefully inspected the box.  It was intricately carved on all sides that she could see and a different language adorned each side.  Reaching out, she attempted to pick up the box.</p>

                                    <p>Just as her fingers touched the box, the room exploded in a flash of unnaturally bright light.  The light seemed to warm and chill her to her very soul all at the same time. Suddenly, she was back on the beach looking up at the cliff again.</p>

                                    <p>“Ariadne, my love.  Please wake up,” Theseus said softly.  He had carefully made his way to her room undetected and he hoped to keep it that way. “Ariadne, wake up.”</p>

                                    <p>“Theseus?  Is that you my love?” she answered, still groggy from sleep.</p>

                                    <p>“It’s me.  Come on, get up.  We have to move quickly.  My ships are waiting in the harbor for us.  We have to leave right now.”</p>

                                    <p>“What happened?  What’s going on?”</p>

                                    <p>“There’s no time to explain.  Get dressed and I will pack some clothes for you to bring.”</p>

                                    <p>“But Theseus, why such haste?”</p>

                                    <p>“I will explain it all later, but for now we must go.”</p>

                                    <p>Taking her hand he led her through the shadowy hallways and darkened streets.  Stopping and hiding whenever necessary to avoid being discovered.  As quickly as they could, they made their way down to the harbor and to his waiting ships.</p>

                                    <p>“Nausitheus. Phaex.  Cast off immediately,” said Theseus.</p>

                                    <p>“Yes, Highness,” said Nausitheus.</p>

                                    <p>The mooring lines were taken in and the black sails were unfurled.  A favorable wind sped them out of the harbor and away from the island of Crete.  Watching the island fall farther and farther behind them, Ariadne silently said goodbye to her family and the only home she had ever known.</p>

                                    <p>For three days they sailed northeast on a course set for Athens. Theseus had promised to tell Ariadne his story of the labyrinth, but it had become increasingly difficult for her to do anything except hang her head over the side of the boat.  A couple of times she almost missed.  When she was not retching over the side, she was recovering in the shade of the shelter that had been constructed for her and Theseus.</p>

                                    <p>Just after noon on the fourth day of their journey they anchored off the coast of the island of Naxos. Feeling great pity for her, Theseus ensured that she was among the first to go ashore. As soon as she set foot on dry land again she bent down and kissed the ground. After more than three days on the water she was glad to have something solid and stable under her feet again.</p>

                                    <p>While the boat crews were busy setting up camp for the night, Theseus and Ariadne took a stroll down the beach.  His hand in hers.  As they walked he regaled her with the story of his adventure in the labyrinth.</p>

                                    <p>“Dear Ariadne,” Theseus began.  “From the moment you placed the sword and twine into my hands I knew what you desired of me.  A wise man would be foolish not to fear for his safety and the safety of those he has sworn to protect in such dire circumstanced.  But, as I entered the labyrinth and the gate shut behind us, I knew without a shadow of a doubt that I would see you again.</p>

                                    <p>“As soon as the guards had left, I found a safe place to secure one end of the twine and gave the remainder to the maiden Periboea to hold and feed out as we traveled through the labyrinthine catacombs.  As the passageways were somewhat narrow in places, we took to moving in a single file.  Soon we had left daylight far behind us and were forced to continue under the light of a single torch.</p>

                                    <p>“Within the very first hour of our captivity we received our initial taste of the Minotaur’s blood thirst.  Rushing at us from the shadows, the beast came at us from behind and threw Periboea to the ground.  Making a play to grab for her, the beast snarled and closed the distance.  Unable to allow my people to diminish, I placed myself in harm’s way and enticed the cursed creature to attack me instead.</p>

                                    <p>“I prospered by the blessings of Poseidon.  For three days the beast and I traded blows.  Neither of us showing any signs of defeated weariness. Finally, I tracked it to its lair deep within the labyrinth.  The walls were covered with the shields, weapons and armor of the warriors who had come before to do battle with the Minotaur in an attempt to save their people. The same thing I was attempting to do. In one large corner of the chamber lay the bones of those that the Minotaur had devoured after they had been defeated in their pitiful attempts to become a hero of their nations.  There were at least two hundred skulls scattered throughout. Both male and female alike.”</p>

                                    <p>“But how did you defeat the Minotaur?” Ariadne asked.</p>

                                    <p>“With his own brain." </p>

                                    <p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

                                    <p>“Once I had discovered its lair, I knew that the battle must end there. Looking around the room I located one shield hanging from the wall that would suit my plan perfectly. It was a seemingly ordinary shield of wood, but affixed to the front of the shield was a spear point.  As soon as I saw the shield I knew what I had to do.</p>

                                    <p>“When the Minotaur came into the chamber, I continued the ongoing battle. I pushed and pulled and kicked and punched all the while dodging and blocking its attacks.  Eventually, I managed to position myself between the beast and the shield.  Bending over and feigning exhaustion I had it right where I wanted it.</p>

                                    <p>“With a final burst of ferocity, the Minotaur charged at me. Its head lowered in an attempt to gore me with its horns.  As it charged I stood there waiting for the inevitable.  Then, just fractions of a second before its horns impaled me, I leaped over it.  With no time to stop its charge, the speed the Minotaur had built up caused it to impale itself on the spear point of that shield.  The point thrusting deeply into the Minotaur’s brain.</p>

                                    <p>“As it stood there, impaled on that shield spear, it let loose with the most horrendous scream I had ever heard.  When I spoke with my companions later, they told me that that scream had echoed throughout the labyrinth for hours.  Knowing that the Minotaur was going nowhere, I drew the sword provided by Daedalus, through you, and with one swift stroke, I cleaved its head from its shoulders.”</p>

                                    <p>“What did you do with the head of Asterius?”</p>

                                    <p>“So, the creature did have a name.”</p>

                                    <p>“Yes. Asterius was my half-brother,” Ariadne said without emotion.</p>

                                    <p>“I am sorry for the half that was your brother, but the other half was pure evil and needed to be destroyed.”</p>

                                    <p>“I agree with you.  Asterius was a cursed creature that should never have existed.”</p>

                                    <p>“To answer your question, I carried the head out of the labyrinth with me. Once we were safely out, having returned along the twine’s path, I sent my companions back to the waiting ships. Before I came to get you, I secreted into your father’s throne room and the left the head of Asterius seated on the throne.”</p>

                                    <p>“That was truly an incredibly harrowing adventure, my love.”</p>

                                    <p>“I made a promise that I would return to you and it was a promise I intended to keep.”</p>

                                    <p>“I am forever grateful that the gods saw fit to return you to me.” Ariadne wrapped her arms around him so tightly that not even air could pass between them.  “Please promise that you will never leave me ever again, my love.”</p>

                                    <p>“I promise you, darling Ariadne, that from this day forth, I will never leave you.”</p>

                                    <p>As the sun was setting they walked back to the newly built campsite, his arm around her shoulder, hers around his waist.  After a small yet delicious meal they retired for the night. Alone in their tent, Theseus and Ariadne made passionate love to each other. Every thrust and climax made her want to scream his name in celebration to the heavens. In their post-coital bliss they fell asleep in each other’s arms.  Her head carefully position on his chest.</p>

                                    <hr>

                                    <p>In the stillness of the night a mist formed along the beach. From within that mist a soft melodic voice called out.</p>

                                    <p>“Theseus.”</p>

                                    <p>Theseus moaned in his sleep.  The voice barely registering in his ears.</p>

                                    <p>“Theseus,” the voice called again.  A little bit louder and closer.</p>

                                    <p>This time he heard the voice but still did not rise from his bed nor open his eyes.</p>

                                    <p>“Theseus!” the voice cried out, this time sounding as if it came from right beside the bed.</p>

                                    <p>Theseus opened his eyes and sat up in bed.  Looking around the tent he could see no one except for Ariadne who still slept soundly.  How could she not hear that voice calling his name?  It was loud enough that the dead in Hades and the Elysian fields could have heard it.</p>

                                    <p>“Come to me Theseus.”  He now realized that he must still be sleeping and that this must be a dream.</p>

                                    <p>Deciding to play along with the dream, he got out of bed and quickly dressed.  Walking out of his tent he was greeted by a mist that seemed to erase the world around him. He could still feel the sand beneath his feet, but he could no longer see it.  All he could see was the mist.</p>

                                    <p>Through the mist he could see a light.  The voice called to him again.  This time he could make out that the voice was decidedly a woman’s voice.  He began walking toward the light which seemed to be the source of the voice.</p>

                                    <p>After walking for what felt like a great distance, a beautiful woman stepped through the mist.  Theseus recognized her instantly from the many paintings and sculptures he had seen of her.</p>

                                    <p>“Oh, great goddess Athena.  Goddess of wisdom and protector of Athens.  I present myself humble before you.  What has thy humble servant done to be honored by thy great visage?”</p>

                                    <p>“Mighty Theseus,” Athena said.  “I come with a warning.  You have freed the house of Minos from a terrible curse.  But, now he seeks retribution for the defiling of his throne and the theft of his daughter.”</p>

                                    <p>“What am I to do, wise Athena?” Theseus asked.</p>

                                    <p>“You must leave the girl here on this island.”</p>

                                    <p>“But we are in love.  I made a vow to her that I would never leave her.”</p>

                                    <p>“Love, you say.  Would you sacrifice your kingdom for love?”</p>

                                    <p>He did not reply.</p>

                                    <p>“If you bring this woman, this Ariadne, daughter of Minos, back to Athens, your kingdom will be destroyed by sword and fire.  Your palace will burn.  Your people slaughtered.  All for the sake of you love for her.”</p>

                                    <p>“I cannot just abandon her here.”</p>

                                    <p>“You must for I cannot protect a kingdom whose king does not abide by my counsel.”</p>

                                    <p>“Forgive me, great Athena.”</p>

                                    <p>“Do not wait for morning.  Awaken my people and sail immediately.”  In the blink of an eye she vanished, denying him a chance to respond. Within a single breath he found himself back in bed, Ariadne’s head still lying on his chest.</p>

                                    <p>Quickly and carefully sliding out of bed, Theseus set about accomplishing the task given him by the goddess.  He woke his people but ordered them to clear the camp without a single sound. He also told them to leave Ariadne’s tent standing and to leave her a week’s worth of food and water.  As soon as all of his orders had been followed in complete silence, they left the island and pointed their ships north to Athens and home.  In his haste and grief, Theseus forgot to have the black sails exchanged for white. Upon their return to Athens, King Aegeus, who had been watching for the ships, saw the black sails.  Knowing the meaning of those black sails he threw himself from the cliffs on the perceived assumption that his son, Theseus, was dead at the hands of the Minotaur.</p>

                                    <hr>

                                    <p>When she woke the next morning, Ariadne was amazed at how quiet the camp was.  Surely, not everyone had slept as late as she had.  They are probably just out hunting game for the evening’s meal, she thought.  Not giving it another thought, she leisurely dressed and prepared for the new day.  Having eaten some wild grapes for breakfast she folded back the tent flap and stepped outside.</p>

                                    <p>She did not go any further. </p>

                                    <p>The beach was completely void of any life except for her.  There were no tents.  No people.  And worst of all, there were no ships.  She was completely and utterly alone.  Theseus had betrayed her.</p>

                                    <p>She went back into her tent and splashed some cool water on her face hoping she would wake up.  This has to be just a nightmare and eventually she would wake up.  Stepping back outside she realized, to her horror, that this was not a dream nor a vision.  It was a living nightmare.  She had been marooned on this island.</p>

                                    <p>Forsaking the day, she threw herself onto her bed and cried.  Her tears pouring so heavily that they could have easily doubled as the source of the great Nile river.  The minutes turned to hours and the hours to day and still she cried.  She had long since grown hoarse from her constant screaming and yelling.  Having sworn a vengeance against Theseus should she ever be rescued from the island.</p>

                                    <p>After many days of grief and sorrow a restless sleep came over her. Unable to cry any more she laid there in a daze.  In her grief she began to wish herself dead.</p>

                                    <p>“Why do you weep, daughter of Minos?”</p>

                                    <p>“Who’s there?” Ariadne croaked, her throat raw from screaming. “Who said that?”</p>

                                    <p>A woman walked into her tent.  She was easily the most beautiful woman Ariadne had ever seen.  Her sun bleached blonde hair hung in perfect tight curls over her slender shoulder.  Her crystal blue eyes were more spectacular than the most perfect of sapphires.  Her body, although loosely covered by a flowing strapless satin dress, could command the blindest of men to do her bidding.</p>

                                    <p>“Why do you cry, fair Ariadne?” said the woman.</p>

                                    <p>“How do you know my name?”</p>

                                    <p>“I know everything about you.  You are Princess Ariadne, eldest daughter of Minos, king of Knossos. Half-sister to your father’s curse, the beast called Minotaur.  I know that the Athenian prince took you from your home and then abandoned you here on this island.”</p>

                                    <p>“Who are you?” Ariadne asked.</p>

                                    <p>“Do you not recognize your goddess, Aphrodite?”</p>

                                    <p>Ariadne quickly fell to the ground in prostration and kneeled before the goddess.</p>

                                    <p>“Great goddess Aphrodite.  I mourn for I have been betrayed and abandoned by the love of my heart. The man I was to spend the rest of my days with.  How could he do that to me?  How could he just leave me like that?”</p>

                                    <p>“The minds of mortal men, although easy to control, are the most difficult to understand.”</p>

                                    <p>“What am I to do, my goddess?  How will I survive here?”</p>

                                    <p>“Fair Ariadne.  Survival will come with each new day.  I too grieve for your loss of a mortal love.  Because a mortal love has betrayed you and abandoned you here, I will send to you a love immortal.  You shall find an eternity of love.”</p>

                                    <p>“But when will he come, Aphrodite? When?”</p>

                                    <p>“Watch for him.”  Then the goddess vanished, leaving Ariadne once again alone on the island.</p>

                                    <p>An immortal love.  What had she done that was so great as to be honored thus so by the goddess of love?</p>

                                    <p>Her grief and sorrow quietly put aside, she arose from her bed and ate the first real meal she had had in nearly a week.  She still felt the sting of Theseus’ betrayal and she vowed to have her revenge on him, but now she had Aphrodite’s promise to look forward to.  She had a reason to go on living.</p>

                                    <p>As the week drew to a close, she realized her food and water rations were running dangerously low.  She had to explore more of the island than just the beach if she was going to survive. In her explorations she discovered a freshwater spring in the midst of a grove of trees.  For food, she could subsist on the grapes that grew wild on the island.  At least for a while.  Eventually, she would have to find other food source, but the grapes would do for a start.</p>

                                    <p>In the middle of her fourth week on the island – mid-May – a fierce storm sent the waves crashing up onto the shore, overrunning the tent that was her only shelter.  After the storm had passed, she gathered the remnants of her camp and moved it to higher ground.  It took her two days to move everything, but the hardest part for her was getting the tent set up.  When they first landed on the island nearly a month earlier, she and Theseus had gone for a walk along the beach so she did not see how difficult it was for even four experienced men to put it up.  And here she was, all alone, trying to put the tent up with no tools like the Athenians must have had.  After several long days and many failed attempts, she was finally able to get the tent pitched.  </p>

                                    <p>Sort of.</p>

                                    <p>It was up, but not exactly steady.</p>

                                    <p>Her days became weeks.  Her weeks became months.  For eight long months she survived on the island.  When she grew tired of only having grapes and wild berries she taught herself how to fish and cook.  Daedalus had long ago taught her how to create fire, but it was not always easy to find enough wood to burn.</p>

                                    <p>Each day that passed she grew more and more weary and jaded waiting for this supposed immortal lover to arrive.  She wanted to trust in Aphrodite’s promise.  But, eight months was such a long time to wait.  For the last couple of weeks, as the weather of late December grew colder and colder, she would climb a tall hill which ended in a sheer cliff and overlooked the sea.  She would often go up there to watch for passing ships.  But after eight months of barely surviving, she was quickly becoming more and more disenchanted.  Her will for survival began to flounder.  On many occasions while she sat atop the hill, she considered the option of hurling herself into the deep watery kingdom of Poseidon.</p>

                                    <p>As December became January she decided she had had enough.  She could no longer find excuses to go on living. With the last of her willpower rapidly wilting like the spring flowers in early fall, she climbed the hill one last time.  Standing on the edge of the cliff she waited.  Hoping for a sign that she should not give herself to Poseidon.</p>

                                    <p>Lifting her right leg in a fashion to take her last living step, she was suddenly dazzled by the reflection of something on the beach. </p>

                                    <p>She put her foot back on solid ground. Turning toward the reflection she tried to make out what it was. It was moving up the beach toward her at a good speed.  The longer she watched, the more she was able to make out.</p>

                                    <p>The reflection came from what looked like a golden chariot being pulled by four pure white stallions.  Watching for a bit longer she began to see that the chariot was being driven by a very handsome looking young man.  Ariadne took the appearance of this man and chariot as the sign she had been looking for.</p>

                                    <p>Without waiting another second, she turned and began to run down the hill.  As she ran she kept looking down the beach hoping for a better glance of the man. She, unfortunately, was not watching the path in front of her.</p>

                                    <p>Her last solid step ended quickly as she tripped over a large root that had grown above ground.  Losing her footing she began to tumble and before she knew what had happened, she was falling through the air.</p>

                                    <p>As soft and forgiving as water usual was, it felt more akin to solid rock as Ariadne slammed into it. The impact knocked the air out of her lungs and she quickly began to sink.  Even against her new found will, Poseidon was still trying to claim her for himself.  The deeper she sank, the darker and colder the water became.  Her agony over the last several months was about to end with a single breath of water. </p>
