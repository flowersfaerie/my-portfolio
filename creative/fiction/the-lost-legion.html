									<p>It was only eight o’clock in the morning and Avianna Leigh Middleton was already having the worst work day ever. Having inherited the bookstore from her Aunt Caitlyn only a few months before, she tried desperately to run it as close to the way Caitlyn would have. Today was proving to be a bit of a challenge though. Not only had she been running late that morning, but two of her sales associates had called in sick. And to make matters worse, the books she had ordered for that morning’s book signing had not been delivered, the local author was late, and the line for the book signing seemed to stretch for miles down the street.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>At twenty-four years old, and only a few years out of high school, she may have known the business inside and out, but she still didn’t feel entirely ready to run it by herself. Her aunt had trained her well though. Now she just had to find the confidence in herself to make it. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Caitlyn had owned the bookstore, The Storyteller, ever since she emigrated from Stonehaven Harbor, Scotland to San Francisco, California, thirty-two years earlier. Six years after coming to America she brought Avianna home to live with her, and had raised her as if she were her own daughter. She was Avianna’s last living relative and when she passed away, Avianna was left entirely alone.  The only things that kept her going were the bookstore and her best friend Bailey.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Avianna first met Bailey Morganna Necole in Kindergarten and they had been best friends ever since. When Avianna’s aunt passed away, Bailey was the only person who could be considered family that she had left.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Hey Bailey,” Avianna said. “Can you call the dealer and see if you can find out where those books are for the book signing and why they haven’t been delivered yet?” She was starting to panic a little bit because the author had finally arrived, but they still didn’t have enough copies of the author’s book to sell. Book signings were always a very profitable event for The Storyteller and if they didn’t have that author’s book in stock then they would lose a lot of good business.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Sure, Avi!” said Bailey. “I’ll call them right now.” Just then the doorbells chimed as a customer walked into the store. “By the way, your favorite customer just walked in.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“What did you say?” Avianna asked, stepping back out of the small office.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Bailey did not say a word, but simply pointed toward the front of the store. There he stood. Duncan Forbes was a vision of heaven for Avianna. Her knees seemed to go weak every time he came into the store, as did every other woman’s, or so she imagined. A blush came to her cheeks as he said good morning to her, his sultry Scottish accent quite unmistakable; even her favorite actor, Gerard Butler, didn’t hold a candle to Duncan. She would often daydream about running her fingers through his wavy soft brown hair and getting lost in his powerful baby blue eyes. Bailey knew that Avianna had a major crush on Duncan and she teased her incessantly about it every chance she got.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Hello, Avianna,” he said as he walked up to the coffee bar to place his morning order. “And how is the most beautiful bookseller in San Francisco doing today?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>With her long honey-blonde hair cascading over her right shoulder in a fishtail braid and her extraordinarily rare violet eyes doing their best not to stare at him, she gave her best impression of a woman who didn’t have a huge crush on him. Being that she was somewhat shy, especially around Duncan, she tended to downplay the beauty which he often complimented. She loved it when he flirted with her like this, though. It was always enough to make her temperature rise and her heart want to leap out of her chest. Trying to maintain some form of composure and not act like a giddy schoolgirl, she calmly said: “Much better now, thank you! And how are you doing today, Duncan?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I can’t complain, but I do wish that I didn’t have so many meetings today. It’s very difficult to get any work done when all you do is sit in meetings all day,” he said with a small laugh. “Other than that, I’m doing quite well, thank you.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“So, what can I get you this morning?” she asked with a smile.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I don’t know. What do you recommend?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Well, the cinnamon crumb cake is simply divine and a caramel chai latte would top it off quite nicely.” On the other hand, she thought, me wrapped in red satin ribbon and served on a silver platter might be even better. She blushed anew at this thought.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“That sounds great. I think I will have the crumb cake and latte. Thank you for the recommendation.” He had been coming into the bookstore a couple of times a week for the last few years and he almost always took her up on her recommendations. All of the staff knew him by name and he was quite familiar with them as well. As she went about preparing his order, he asked: “Avianna, isn’t your birthday coming up soon? You’re going to be what, nineteen this year?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I’m very flattered that you remembered,” she answered. “My birthday is actually less than a week from now, on Wednesday the ninth.” It was still hard for her to believe that it had only been twenty-five years considering all of the heartache that she had been through in her short lifetime.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Do you have any plans for your birthday?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Not really. Aunt Caitlyn was planning something really special for my birthday this year, just like she had every other year. But since her funeral three months ago I haven’t really felt like celebrating. It just won’t be the same without her. You know what I mean? So, I’ll probably just spend a nice quiet evening at home watching an old movie on television or something.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I know your aunt really wanted to be there for your birthday this year. I hope that you are still able to have a wonderful birthday even without your aunt physically here with you. I have a strange feeling this one is going to be filled with tons of magic for you,” he said. “Thank you again for the coffee and cake. Will I see you again tomorrow?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“It’s a date! Have a great day at work, Duncan!” she said as he turned and walked out the door and headed to work. As soon as the words had slipped from her lips she felt the heat of embarrassment rise up from within her very core. Why couldn’t she have said something less obvious like “I’ll be here!” or “I can’t wait!” Heck, even something like “I have belly button lint growing out of my ears” would have been less embarrassing for her. She just had to hope that he hadn’t read into it as much as she hoped he would.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>After her pleasant encounter with Duncan the rest of her day seemed to go on without a hitch. And as if by some miracle, the books for the signing finally arrived at around eight-thirty even though Bailey was never able to get a hold of the dealer. The day continued and the bookstore never seemed to empty of customers. Patron after patron continued to pour into the store which meant that Avianna and Bailey had to constantly be splitting their time between helping customers and making sure that the shelves remained stocked and organized. If it weren’t for the afternoon shift of part-timers coming on at noon, the two women might never have gotten a break. Even with the added help, there just seemed to be no end to the constant flow of customers.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>An hour before closing, Caitlyn’s lawyer came into the store. Charles August was a very sweet gentleman in his late fifties and she noticed that his hair had definitely grown more salt than pepper since the last time that she saw him. Even for an older gentleman, she saw that he stayed in pretty good shape, despite his wife’s delicious cooking. She had had many dealings with him in the weeks following her aunt’s death and his wife, Chelsea, provided several meals while she mourned, but it had been months since she last had a visit from him and she was very curious as to why he was here now.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Good evening, Mr. August,” Avianna said as she shook his hand. “I didn’t think I’d be seeing you again. What can I do for you tonight?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Actually, I’m here on business, Ms. Middleton,” he said. “I have some paperwork for you to sign and, per your aunt’s Last Will and Testament, I am to deliver this envelope to you exactly five days before your twenty-fifth birthday which is on Wednesday, if I am not mistaken.” He pulled a letter-size manila envelope out of his briefcase and placed it before her on the counter.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“What’s in it, Mr. August?” </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I have no idea. Your aunt gave it to me sealed and with strict instructions that it was for your eyes only. Now I have a little paperwork for you to sign, if you don’t mind.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I thought we had already taken care of all of the paperwork months ago.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“This paperwork goes along with the envelope. You can read through it if you like, but I can explain it to you just as easily. As you are well aware, I was the executor of your aunt’s estate. Part of that estate was a very sizeable trust fund in your name. These forms authorize me to act as executor of your trust fund and allows me to give you access to that money.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“When you say ‘sizeable,’how much are we talking about?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“This is easily the largest trust fund I, personally, have ever managed. Ms. Middleton, you are now an extremely rich young woman and I do hope that you will use it wisely.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“How much, Mr. August?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“In excess of eight hundred million dollars.” Completely shocked, Avianna just stood there staring at him, but was not seeing him at all. “Your Aunt Caitlyn told me that this is very old money. When I asked her how old, all she said was ‘ancient.’”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Avianna remained silent. She could see his lips were still moving, but her ears stopped listening as her mind dealt with the shock that she was now an incredibly rich woman. As a new business owner she was always worried about money, but that worry had suddenly just evaporated with the news of her inheritance of the trust fund.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Ms. Middleton, are you all right?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Huh? What? Yeah, I’m okay. Just really surprised is all.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I hate to rush you, but Chelsea is making my favorite dinner tonight and I would really like to get home for it,” he said with a small laugh. “Just sign your name on the pages that I have marked and I will take care of everything else. You’ll have access to it by Monday morning.” Without another word she signed her name on the documents.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I want to thank you for your time, Ms. Middleton.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Thank you for coming by, Mr. August. Can I at least buy you a cup of coffee before you leave?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“That would be nice. Thank you!” he said. As he continued, Avianna prepared a cup of coffee for him. “I didn’t want to take up too much of you time. I just wanted to drop off that envelope for you. Once again, I am very sorry about your aunt.” </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Thanks.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“She was a wonderful woman and will be very dearly missed. I hope that you have a wonderful night, Ms. Middleton, and a very happy birthday. And if you ever need anything, feel free to call me day or night. You have my phone number.” With that, he closed up his leather briefcase and, after shaking her hand, walked back out to his car, coffee in hand.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>After Mr. August left, Avianna locked the front door and went about her normal closing procedures. Avianna, Bailey, and their three part time employees busied themselves getting the store cleaned up and ready for the next day. Avianna stood at the front counter going over the day’s receipts while Bailey and the others straightened the shelves. By ten o’clock the store had been cleaned and prepped, the receipts tallied, and the lights turned out.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>As they were leaving the store Bailey turned to Avianna and asked: “So, what did Caitlyn’s lawyer want?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“OH CRAP!” Avianna cried out as she pulled her keys back out of her purse and unlocked the front door to the store. “Thanks for reminding me, Bailey. I almost forgot it.” She walked back to the front counter and grabbed the envelope Mr. August had given her earlier. “He gave me this envelope and said that my aunt had put it in her Will that I was to receive this thing exactly five days before my Birthday. I mean, come on, can he possibly get any more cryptic.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I guess not,” said Bailey. “So, what’s in it?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I don’t know. I haven’t taken the time to open it up and look yet.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“How about this, why don’t we go back to your apartment, make some tea and find out together.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Actually, that sounds like a great idea,” Avianna said as she relocked the door. “And I don’t know about you but I’m starving. What do you say we grab some Chinese take-out on the way.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Yummy,” Bailey said. “Let’s get the food and go find out what’s in that envelope.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Climbing into their separate cars they drove to Avianna’s apartment. Once they were inside the apartment, Avianna started boiling some water for tea while Bailey got dinner set up in the living room. As they ate, they talked about what they thought was in the envelope. Both were very eager to discover its actual contents.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>After dinner, Avi picked up the envelope and they prepared themselves for the mystery to be unraveled. When she looked inside, all she found was a thin stack of papers. Pulling them out, she discovered very quickly what they were.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Well, what is it?” Bailey asked impatiently.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“It’s a letter from my aunt,” Avianna replied.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Okay, I’m dying here, Avi. Why don’t you read it to me so we can get to the bottom of this mystery?”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Avianna sat back in her chair and proceeded to read the letter out loud.</p>

                                        <p>September 29, 1993</p>

                                        <p>My Dearest Avianna,</p>

                                        <p>As I write this, I can feel my body failing me. I know that I don't have much longer before this poison kills me and you are left all alone in this world. But, my darling daughter, you will never be alone. My love, and the love of your ancestors will live on in you forever. Our strengths are now passed on to you. </p>

                                        <p>My entire life has revolved around keeping secrets. Secrets from my friends. Secrets from my sister. Secrets from the world. But most importantly, secrets from you. Now that I have run out of time, there is so much that I need to tell you. Please forgive me for not telling you sooner; I was trying to protect you from this for as long as I possibly could. I only hope that this letter gets delivered to you when it is supposed to.</p>

                                        <p>There is no easy place to start this, so I will just start at the beginning. Your parents, Mhairi and Collin, weren't killed in a car accident. They were murdered because they were protecting you. I brought you here to San Francisco to live with me because I needed to keep you safe from whomever had them killed. In doing so, I fear that I may have put you in even more danger. I'm sorry that I could not tell you this before now, but it was the only way I could think of to actually keep you safe even after I’m gone.</p>

                                        <p>For more than two thousand years our mother's mothers have been the guardian of a dangerous secret that I must now, regrettably, pass on to you. For your own safety, I cannot say much in this letter, but the key will open a safe at the bookstore, and I pray that you use it. In the book you will find answers to some of the questions that you may be asking right now. </p>

                                        <p>I know that I am putting you in harm's way, Avianna, but you must protect this secret at all cost from those who would seek its power for their own desires. Time and time again, our mothers have had to defend against numerous attacks in locations all around the world. We have not always kept this secret under Dunnottar, but it has always been our family which has protected it against all enemies.</p>

                                        <p>Avianna, my darling daughter, there is so much more to this story. Your role goes far beyond just simply guarding the secret. You are the key to our family’s survival. </p>

                                        <p>I love you, Avianna, and I pray that you stay safe.</p>

                                        <p>Forever My Love,<br>

                                        Caitlyn Lea Watson</p>
                                    </span>

                                    <p>After several breathtaking minutes of silence, Bailey spoke up saying: “Oh My God, Avi! That was so intense.”</p>

                                    <p>“You’re telling me,” she replied. “I have no idea what to even think about it.” They were so stunned by what Caitlyn had said, hardly a single word was spoken by either of them for the next several minutes as their minds struggled to digest the contents of the letter.</p>

                                    <p>“I wonder what Dunnottar is?” Bailey pondered out loud.</p>

                                    <p>“Castle Dunnottar. It’s the ruins of a castle two miles south of where I was born in Stonehaven. It was built on a high plateau that overlooks the North Sea which spans the distance between Scotland and Denmark.” Avianna’s mother had taken her to Castle Dunnottar on numerous occasions before their accident. She remembered thinking it was very beautiful there. </p>

                                    <p>“Maybe we’ll have to visit it someday.”</p>

                                    <p>“I’d love that. I’m just trying to figure out why she said ‘under Dunnottar.’ As far as I know, the plateaus is just a solid piece of rock. There aren’t any caves or anything underneath it.” But Avianna couldn’t help imagining the possibilities.</p>

                                    <p>“Wouldn’t it be really cool if there was like a hidden cave somewhere?” Bailey said, her eyes opening wide and the corners of her mouth pulling back to form an excited grin.</p>

                                    <p>“That would be pretty cool.”</p>

                                    <p>“So what are you going to do now?” asked Bailey.</p>

                                    <p>“Well, I’m obviously gonna use that key tomorrow morning. I’m really curious as to what it unlocks.” She was more than just curious, she was nervous about what she was going to find. </p>

                                    <p>An hour later, the women said their goodbyes and Bailey headed home to get some rest. Avianna, unable to sleep, read through the letter several more times trying to see if she had missed some hidden meaning that her aunt was trying to disguise in the text. Caitlyn was always giving her varying types of puzzles to solve as she was growing up. She secretly hoped it was just an elaborate joke her aunt was playing on her. By two o’clock in the morning she had finally fallen asleep on the couch. She didn’t sleep very well, however, as she had several very weird dreams about a tribe of warriors fighting against an army of soldiers in a lush green valley.</p>

                                    <hr>

                                    <p>Six a.m. seemed to come much quicker than Avianna was ready for as a melodic ringing woke her out of a dead sleep. She slapped her hand at an imaginary alarm clock on the coffee table, but the melody continued. In a groggy half-sleep, it took her a moment to realize that it was her cell phone ringing.</p>

                                    <p>“Hello,” she said, exhaustion very much evident in her voice.</p>

                                    <p>“Is this Ms. Avianna Middleton?” the male voice asked.</p>

                                    <p>“Would you hate me if I said no?”</p>

                                    <p>“Ms. Middleton, this is Lieutenant Thomas Stokes with the San Francisco Police Department. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we responded to a silent alarm that originated from your bookstore, The Storyteller. I’m afraid we’re gonna need you to come down here as we have a few questions we need to ask you as the owner of the business.”</p>

                                    <p>“Thank you for calling, Lieutenant. I’ll be there shortly.” Without even saying goodbye she hung up the phone and rolled over in bed. Just then her alarm clock in the bedroom started screaming its harsh tones as if it knew she was about to go back to sleep after talking to Lt. Stokes. Rolling out of her makeshift bed, she skipped her normal morning shower and grabbed the first pair of jeans and a blouse that she came across, slipped on some flats, grabbed her purse and keys and walked out the door.</p>

                                    <p>It was only a five mile drive to work, but the downtown traffic was extraordinarily bad that morning. As she got closer to the store, she was able to make out the flashing red and blue bubblegum lights of the patrol cars. Parking her car as close to the store as she could, she got out and walked to the store in search of Lieutenant Stokes. Stopping dead in her tracks, she got her first view of the burglary and vandalism that the police were investigating. All of the windows were broken and the place was a complete mess. It seemed like whomever had broken in was looking for something specific because even the small office was destroyed. Who could have done this and what were they looking for, she thought to herself. She became very worried that the contents of the safe were what this burglar was after.</p>
