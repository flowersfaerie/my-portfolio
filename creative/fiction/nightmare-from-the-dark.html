									<h3 class="major">Chapter #: The Disappearance of Jackson</h3>
                                    <p>“The next house is a split level home built on a hill. The fun part of this house is that the garage is built into the side of the hill,” said Rachel Allen, realtor extraordinaire.</p>
                                    <p>“What part of town is it in?” Asked Janelle Cranston.</p>
                                    <p>“The home is very well priced even though it is in the older part of town.”</p>
                                    <p>“Isn’t that the rich part of town?” said David Cranston.</p>
                                    <p>“It is, but this house happens to fit within your price range. And according to the MLS listing, it incorporates nearly every one of the things you said you wanted in a home.”</p>
                                    <p>“I don’t know. What do you think, Honey?”</p>
                                    <p>“I guess it couldn’t hurt to take a look at it,” said Janelle.</p>
                                    <p>Turning the key in the ignition, Rachel drove the Cranston family across town to the next house on her list. This was also the only house on her list which she had not personally been to yet.</p>
                                    <p>As Rachel drove, she continued talking to David and Janelle about the house and their wants and desires for a home. But all Danielle could think about was that she was wasting an entire day of her summer break. She had just finished her freshman year at the local high school and really wanted to be hanging out with her friends by the pool talking about their crushes.</p>
                                    <p>She was, however, looking forward to the fact that they would soon be moving out of the small two-bedroom apartment and into an actual house. A house with a bedroom just for her. She hated that she had been forced to share her bedroom with her little brother.</p>
                                    <p>After the Hummer pulled to a stop in front of the house, the car doors opened and closed in succession as Rachel and the Cranstons prepared to explore the possibilities of this being their new home. The path leading up to the front door followed a gentle curve around a well-manicured flower garden full of color and beauty. The wood siding was painted a sickly blue-grey color whereas the front door was a very welcoming white. A melodic chorus of bells flittered through the air as the butterfly windchime swayed in the gentle breeze.</p>
                                    <p>“This house is listed as vacant,” Rachel said as she retrieved the house key from the realtor lock box hanging from the door knob. “I love being able to show empty houses because it allows you to envision your own furniture and knick-knacks in each room.”</p>
                                    <p>“How long has the house been empty?” David asked.</p>
                                    <p>“It’s only been vacant for about two months, so the house is still prime for the picking.” Rachel turned the key in the lock and opened the door. As she opened the door, Danielle heard a long gasping of air, almost as if the house had been holding its breath since the last time the door had been opened.</p>
                                    <p>Sweeping her right hand in front of her, she ushered them into the house. The carpets were a plushy piled cream color and the eggshell white walls still had that freshly painted smell to them.</p>
                                    <p>“The first floor has a large area for both living and dining rooms. From the dining room you transition into the spacious modern kitchen. All of the kitchen appliances are relatively new within the last year.</p>
                                    <p>“Why did the previous owner put the house up for sale?” asked Janelle.</p>
                                    <p>“From what the seller’s agent told me this morning, the previous owner needed to sell the house for family and financial reasons. Beyond that, I don’t know.”</p>
                                    <p>“Can we go upstairs, Mom?” Jackson interrupted.</p>
                                    <p>“Go ahead, Honey,” she replied. “But take your sister with you.” Even though she said the words, he was already halfway up the stairs, Danielle in tow, before she could even finish saying them.</p>
                                    <p>As Jackson ran up the stairs to pick out his bedroom first, Danielle casually walked. She knew that she would get the bigger bedroom either way, simply because she was older. Both bedrooms were fairly similar in size, but Danielle felt pulled toward neither of them. She did, however, like the room which overlooked the basement garage and figured she would probably choose that one if they bought the house.</p>
                                    <p>“Danielle! Jackson!” Janelle called out from the bottom of the stairs, her right hand on the railing and her left foot casually placed on the first step. “Come on you two. We’re gonna go down and check out the garage area.”</p>
                                    <p>Being ten years old, Jackson seemed to have an unlimited supply of energy as he shot down the short hallway and nearly leaped down the stairs to the first floor. At fourteen, Danielle had a little more self-control.</p>
                                    <p>Once Danielle had finally joined the rest of the family, Rachel led the way downstairs to the basement garage. Danielle being the last one down. Her right hand on the rail as an instinctive safety measure, she raised her left hand almost uncontrollably to the amethyst pendant handing from a leather cord around her neck. She wrapped her fingers around the stone and walked down the stairs. She had never been in a basement before, but with each step down she began to notice a slight drop in temperature, which she figured was probably normal.</p>
                                    <p>With only three more steps to go before she reached the bottom, a bright light suddenly shattered the darkness as Rachel activated the automatic garage door opener. Rachel moved to the center of the garage and began motioning to different areas as she talked about the space.</p>
                                    <p>But Danielle’s attention was drawn in a different direction.</p>
                                    <p>“Daddy, there’s another room over here,” Danielle said as she pointed to the left.</p>
                                    <p>“That must be the laundry room,” said Rachel.</p>
                                    <p>“No, it’s not. The washer and dryer go over there,” she said as she looked over to where the hookups were by the large basin on the right side of the garage.</p>
                                    <p>“What’s in there, Sweetheart?” her dad asked.</p>
                                    <p>Danielle walked over to the room and, taking a single step inside, immediately jumped backwards to the wall by the stairs.</p>
                                    <p>“Danielle!” David yelled as he ran over to her. “What happened? Are you okay?” As tears streamed down her cheeks he hugged her to his chest, protecting her from whatever had happened to her.</p>
                                    <p>“There’s something in there, Daddy.” She continued to sob against his chest.</p>
                                    <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
                                    <p>“There’s something in there!” She buried her face even deeper into his chest, her words and moaning becoming incoherent.</p>
                                    <p>“What did it do to you, Sweetie?” he asked.</p>
                                    <p>Janelle walked over to the room to turn on the light. Stepping into the room, she reached up to feel along the wall for the light switch. “There’s nothin’ in . . .” She didn’t finish. She stood there silent and motionless, her fingers only inches from the light switch.</p>
                                    <p>“What did you say, Janelle?”</p>
                                    <p>“Daddy, there’s something evil in that room. I felt like whatever it was had reached into my chest and nearly squeezed the life out of my heart, like in a death grip or something.” Each word was a struggle for her to say, and breathing didn’t come much easier. Her entire chest burned with pain as her lungs screamed for air.</p>
                                    <p>Turning slightly to glance over his shoulder, David said: “Janelle, Honey, do you see anything in there?”</p>
                                    <p>She did not answer.</p>
                                    <p>Janelle stood there in the doorway to the room, her hand still motionless on the wall below the light switch.</p>
                                    <p>Jackson walked over to her and tapped her on the arm. “Mom? Are you okay? Mom!?”</p>
                                    <p>She still did not answer.</p>
                                    <p>From the quiet stillness of the black room came a deafening whispered exhalation as if from a breath held far too long. But only Danielle heard it.</p>
                                    <p>“Janelle?”</p>
                                    <p>A terrified moan squeezed out from Janelle’s lungs, but still she did not move.</p>
                                    <p>“Janelle? Honey, answer me!” Danielle could feel her dad preparing to stand up to go to his wife. “What’s wrong, Janelle?”</p>
                                    <p>“Mommy?”</p>
                                    <p>Within the space of a second exhalation from the blackness, Janelle was thrust backward, landing atop David and Danielle.</p>
                                    <p>And Jackson was yanked into the room.</p>
                                    <p>“JACKSON!” Danielle screamed into the darkness.</p>
                                    <p>Rachel ran to the doorway, reached in and turned on the light. As the room was built into the side of the hill, there was no window in the room. Every wall was painted black. The only source of light that Danielle could see in the room was a black light. And when she finally managed to stand back up and move to the room, she saw that every wall and the ceiling were completely covered in what she thought were probably Satanic symbols and writings.</p>
                                    <p>But Jackson was nowhere to be found. He had vanished inside a room that only had one exit.</p>
