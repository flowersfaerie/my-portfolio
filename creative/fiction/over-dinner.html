									<p>“What the fuck are you doing here, Will?” Ten years without a word and now here he is sitting at my booth. It takes every ounce of my willpower not to grab his table knife and plunge it right through his hand.</p>
                                    <p>“Hi Liz.”</p>
                                    <p>“Hi Liz? HI LIZ?” I can’t believe his nerve. “You’ve been gone since the summer after our high school graduation and all you’ve got to say to me is ‘Hi Liz?’”</p>
                                    <p>“Look, I’ve been sitting out in my truck freezing for the last two hours trying to decide if I actually had the courage to come in here and face you or not. I’m still not sure if I do.”</p>
                                    <p>“Then order and get the fuck out.” I don’t want to be around him any longer than I have to and the last forty-five seconds has already been way too long.</p>
                                    <p>“Just give me the special, okay.”</p>
                                    <p>As I walk away from his table to turn in his food order I look back over my shoulder and quietly hiss. “Oh yeah, you’ll get the special all right.”</p>
                                    <p>“You all right, E?” Mac says as I walk into the kitchen with Will’s food order.</p>
                                    <p>“He’s back. That sonofabitch is actually back and he’s sitting at my booth.”</p>
                                    <p>“Who’s back?”</p>
                                    <p>“Will.”</p>
                                    <p>“High school Will?”</p>
                                    <p>“Yeah, you remember him.”</p>
                                    <p>“You want I should throw his ass back out into the snow, kid? Just say the word and he’s gone.”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s okay. I just need some time. I . . . I just can’t go back out there right now.” I step over to Mac’s little office just off the kitchen and sit down in his chair. My head feels like it’s about to explode.</p>
                                    <p>Hate. Anger. Love.</p>
                                    <p>I can understand the hate and anger, but why am I feeling love of all things? I haven’t seen him for ten years, not an email, not a single phone call, not even a goddamn text message saying hello. And there certainly wasn’t any child support. How the fuck am I feeling any love for this asshole. I try to push those feelings out of my head.</p>
                                    <p>My heart isn’t so easily persuaded.</p>
                                    <p>When I look up in an effort to gain some psychic strength from Mac, he looks back at me for a moment. I lower my head back down into the cup of my upturned palms and hear him say “Hey Jazz, let the girls know that table seven’s toxic.” Toxic is the word we use when one of our exes comes into the restaurant. It’s our way of saying to each other that this person will get served, eventually, but it will be with the world’s worst service.</p>
                                    <p>Turning back, he walks the few feet over to the office where I’m sitting and asks, “Is this his check, E?” There are five of us that waitress at Mac’s Diner and he has nicknames for all of us: aside from me there’s Jazz for Jasmyn, Ritzy for Rita, Sparkles for Nikki — she’s the youngest, still in high school and as energetic as a super-caffeinated hamster — then there’s Belles. Belles is a little shy and quiet, but sweet as a cup of peppermint hot chocolate with a candy cane stirrer on a frigid Christmas Eve. </p>
                                    <p>“Yeah, that’s his order,” I say. “Why?”</p>
                                    <p>“You know them toxics, they get the gravy.” The gravy is Mac’s special sauce. It’s reserved only for our rotten exes who are brave enough to come into the Diner. He’s never told me exactly what’s in it, but I did see some ghost peppers in the kitchen a few years ago and they’re not in any of the recipes Mac uses. The presentation of the gravy always comes in the form of Mac’s Toxic Fire Challenge, so at least the person still has a choice.</p>
                                    <p>“But Mac, I . . .”</p>
                                    <p>“Don’t fuss over it, E. It’s already done. At least it will be in a minute.” </p>
                                    <p>“Hey Sparkles,” he calls out into the dining room, “grab me the gravy bottle from under the counter, will ya.” Nikki had an abusive ex-boyfriend who once found himself at the wrong end of that gravy bottle. When Mac asks her to get it, I know she is probably smiling as she remembers what happened to her ex. </p>
                                    <p>Before I know what’s happening, gravy is flowing out over the edges of Will’s chicken fried steak. It soaks into the skin of his baked potato and broccoli. I’m gonna enjoy watching this. I’ve been dreaming of doing the exact same thing ever since Mac first started the Toxic Fire Challenge.</p>
                                    <p>As he looks back over his shoulder at me again I see a devilish grin spreading across his face. “Anyone messes with my girls, and I mess back.”</p>
                                    <p>“You okay, Eliza?” Belles asks as she squats down in front of me, holding my hands in hers.</p>
                                    <p>“I’ll be okay. Just needed a breather.”</p>
                                    <p>“Not sure if this will help at all, but Nikki is about to make a delivery to table seven, if you want to watch?” It’s generally understood that the person whose ex it is will not be the one to wait their table.</p>
                                    <p>“Can you stop her? I need to do this one myself.” I’ve been bottling this anger up for ten years and now that he’s actually here, I’m gonna give him a piece of my mind.</p>
                                    <p>Belles calls Nikki back into the kitchen, plate still in her hand. Taking the plate from Nikki, I step out into the dining room and head straight for Will.</p>
                                    <p>As I set the plate down in front of him he gently grasps my wrist.</p>
                                    <p>“Let go of me.” I don’t want to be around him any longer than it takes to tell him to go screw himself. And him touching me is definitely out of the question.</p>
                                    <p>“Wait a minute. I just wanna talk.”</p>
                                    <p>“You can talk all you like. This is a free country after all. But it doesn’t mean I have to stand here and listen to it.” I try to pull away and his grip tightens around my wrist.</p>
                                    <p>“Liz, I need to talk to you about what happened.”</p>
                                    <p>I don’t want to keep standing here. I want to see him suffering like I have suffered.</p>
                                    <p>“I’ll make a deal with you. If you can finish your entire meal in under ten minutes, one minute for every year you haven’t been a part of Connor’s life, I’ll give you two minutes to say what you’ve got to say.” No one has ever won Mac’s challenge.</p>
                                    <p>“As hungry as I am right now, I don’t think that’ll be a problem.”</p>
                                    <p>“Give me just a minute before you start.” I turn and walk behind the counter to ring Mac’s challenge bell. The diner becomes so quiet that a person can hear the distant whistle of the 8:20 p.m. train as it pushes north into Canada.</p>
                                    <p>I know that I’m the one who has to announce what’s about to happen. Most of the regulars look on eagerly.</p>
                                    <p>“Good evening everyone. Welcome to Mac’s Diner and the beginning of our famous Toxic Fire Challenge. As some of you may already know, Mac started this challenge ten years ago to test the intestinal fortitude of some of our bravest guests. Will Moffat, a former resident of this town and high school quarterback, has accepted the challenge. He will have ten minutes to finish his dinner, and an additional five minutes before he is allowed to have anything other than water.” </p>
                                    <p>From behind me I hear a couple of teenage girls giggling. They know what’s coming. I can see some of the older patrons who know the real purpose of the challenge whispering amongst themselves as they try to figure out what he has done to be worthy of it.</p>
                                    <p>Turning to Will I say, “While you may be hungry and while ten minutes may seem like plenty of time to finish your meal, there is something you should know: if you don’t finish, there are no second chances and you certainly won’t get your two minutes.” While most of the customers don’t know what I mean by this, Will sure does. “Will, do you accept of your own free will, the pain and suffering that you will experience during the next fifteen minutes?” We’re required to ask this and have them sign a release in order to avoid any legal ramifications. “This is your last chance to back out.”</p>
                                    <p>“Wait, what do you mean by ‘fire challenge’?”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s all explained in the release form Rita just set in front of you. You might want to read it before you sign it so you know what you’re really getting yourself into. If you do want to sign it, feel free to cut up your meat and potato before we get started. If you choose not to sign it, you are free to leave immediately and permanently.” After reading and signing the release he slices his steak and potato into bite-sized pieces.</p>
                                    <p>“Guess I’m ready to start. Is there a clock or something?”</p>
                                    <p>“I get to watch the clock. You get to eat.”</p>
                                    <p>“Ten minutes, right?”</p>
                                    <p>“And . . . Go!”</p>
                                    <p>Will quickly stabs his first chunk of steak and slides it into his mouth. As he chews the ghost peppers begin to work their magic. Beads of sweat form on his forehead. Ten seconds after putting the first bite in his mouth I can see that he now fully understands what a fire challenge is. It takes him a full minute to recover from the first bite before he attempts the second one. </p>
                                    <p>“Are you kidding me with this, Liz?” Tears run down his cheeks almost as fast as the snot from his nose.</p> 
                                    <p>“Less talking and more chewing. You’ve got fewer than nine minutes to go.”</p>
                                    <p>He shoves a third and fourth chunk into his mouth and takes a deep swallow of water. When I see the look on his face I have a hard time maintaining my neutral expression. </p>
                                    <p>At the five minute mark I am amazed that he has actually finished half of his steak and potato, and all of his broccoli. Most contenders have already quit by this point. He must be in serious pain because he continues to drink glass after glass of water. His hands regularly slap the table. I guess this is his attempt to externalize the pain and take his mind off of his mouth.</p>
                                    <p>I have never seen anyone eat a meal this quickly. With only two minutes remaining, I begin to worry that he may actually finish my challenge. Normally, Mac allows up to twenty-five minutes for the challenge, but I really don’t want to suffer through those two minutes of having to listen to him explain himself.</p>
                                    <p>“One minute to go, Will.” The diner patrons have forgotten their own meals and are cheering him on. I can’t believe he is actually going to finish. I might just have to give him those two minutes out of pure pity. But, then I remember that he still has to survive the five minutes of blazing hell after the food is gone before he is allowed anything to ease the pain.</p>
                                    <p>As the gathered crowd begins counting down the final ten second, Will forces the final chunk of his steak into his mouth and swallows without chewing. I’m in total awe that he has actually finished. I can’t let it show. He can’t know that, in a twisted sort of way, I am proud of him for doing it.</p>
                                    <p>With all of this anger to fuel my hate for him, this goddamn love that I’m still feeling is making me feel proud of him instead. I can feel my heart trying to jump for joy, just like it did when he threw the winning touchdown pass at the state championship during our senior year of high school. Why can’t I just hate him and be done with it?</p>
                                    <p>After his five minutes of pain and a round of congratulations the commotion dies down as everyone goes back to their own meals. Mac had a standing rule for the Toxic Fire Challenge, if anyone actually does finish it, their meal is free and they get a dish of ice cream to soothe the burn.</p>
                                    <p>Sitting down in the booth across from him, I slide the bowl of raspberry sherbet in front of him. His mouth must really be on fire right now because the sherbet is gone almost before I can blink.</p>
                                    <p>“Oh, God!” he says with an exhaled sigh. “That feels so much better.” </p>
                                    <p>I say nothing.</p>
                                    <p>“So, I guess I get those two minutes now, huh?”</p>
                                    <p>“I’m here aren’t I?”</p>
                                    <p>“Liz, I’m sorry.”</p>
                                    <p>These are the two words I’ve been wanting to hear and dreading hearing for the last ten years. He does owe me this apology, but I’m afraid he wants something from me that I’m unwilling and unable to give him. I really can’t believe he would have the nerve to come in here and just blurt that out. </p>
                                    <p>“I was a complete asshole to you. I can come up with about a million of them, but I won’t bore you with any worthless excuses.”</p>
                                    <p>“Then what the hell do you want?” I may be having severely mixed emotions right now, but there’s no way I’m gonna give him the satisfaction of bowing to his paper thin apologies.</p>
                                    <p>“The only thing I want is to get to know Connor.”</p>
                                    <p>“What on God’s green earth makes you think I’d ever let you see my son?”</p>
                                    <p>“Liz, it’s not what you think.”</p>
                                    <p>“You’re right, it’s probably not what I think.” It’s probably worse. “Why don’t you explain it to me, Will? Because I’m at a total loss as to why you would choose to come back now.”</p>
                                    <p>Will folds his fingers in front of him and, closing his eyes, lets out a long deep sigh. “Give me a break, Liz. My mouth just went through hell to earn these two minutes. The least you can do is let me actually have them.”</p>
                                    <p>With a quick exhale I say, “Fine. Just get it over with.”</p>
                                    <p>“My dad’s dead.”</p>
                                    <p>I haven’t seen him since he moved out of town six months ago, but Will’s dad, Tom, had been a real comfort to me after Will disappeared. I loved that he was such a good grandfather to Connor. I knew he had been sick a lot, but he never made it seem like it was that serious. </p>
                                    <p>“When did he die?”</p>
                                    <p>“He passed away two months ago. I came back for the funeral so we could bury him next to my mom. I stayed away from you because I didn’t want to dig up old memories. But when I saw you through the diner window the day of the funeral, you just looked so happy. I couldn’t take that away from you. So, I left.”</p>
                                    <p>Even in my anger I still feel sorry for him. I wish I’d known Tom had died, I would have taken Connor to say his goodbyes. I don’t want to cry in front of Will, but I can feel my heart trying to betray me again. First it’s love and now it’s sorrow. Why is my heart doing this to me?</p>
                                    <p>“I’m so sorry about your dad,” I say while trying to keep at least a semi-rigid look on my face. I really have to be on my guard to not let my emotions show. </p>
                                    <p>“After the funeral I started to think about how little I really knew my dad which got me thinking about what I’ve done to Connor. I know I haven’t been around for the last ten years of his life and there’s no excuse for that, but I’d really like to get to know him.”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s never going to happen.”</p>
                                    <p>“I just want a chance to get to know our son.”</p>
                                    <p>“Our son? No, he’s my son,” I say loud enough for the whole diner to hear. “You gave up all rights to be a father to him when you ran out on me ten years ago.”</p>
                                    <p>“You don’t understand, Liz,” he pleads. “If you’d just hear me out I’ll expl . . .”</p>
                                    <p>“I don’t need to hear anything. Our son doesn’t exist. My son, on the other hand, does not deserve to have you pop into his life after ten years only to disappear again when you get bored.”</p>
                                    <p>“I’ve changed. I’m not the same person I used to be.” He reaches out for my hands again and just brushes my fingers before I pull them back, settling them in my lap.</p>
                                    <p>“Do you honestly expect me to believe that, Will? The only thing you’ve done tonight to prove that you’re willing to fight for anything is finishing that goddamn challenge.”</p>
                                    <p>“No matter what you may think, I do still love you. But, I’m not here to get back together with you. I’m only here because I want to attempt to be a good father to our son.”</p>
                                    <p>“Stop calling him that. Connor is not your son, and he never will be.”</p>
                                    <p>“Just give me a chance, Liz.”</p>
                                    <p>“It’s too late for that, Will.” I can’t hold the tears back any longer. I have no reason to trust him regardless of how he may have changed. “It’s years too late.”</p>
                                    <p>“Liz, I’ll prove to you that I can be trusted. That I have changed.”</p>
                                    <p>I can’t stand to listen to him anymore. It hurts too much. I slide out of the booth and stand next to the table.</p>
                                    <p>“You’re two minutes are up and I have to get back to work.”</p>
                                    <p>“Liz . . .” he pleads.</p>
                                    <p>“No. Get out, Will. If you’re not gone in the next thirty seconds, I’m gonna call Mac out here. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to carry out the promise he made to you the first time he threw you out of here ten years ago.”</p>
                                    <p>He doesn’t move. I gather from his raised eyebrows that he remembers that Mac had promised to use his head for batting practice if he ever came back into the diner.</p>
                                    <p>“Mac . . .” I say loudly in the direction of the kitchen.</p>
                                    <p>He still does not move.</p>
                                    <p>“Liz, I’m not giving up on this.”</p>
                                    <p>Mac comes out of the back, baseball bat in hand, and walks straight towards us.</p>
                                    <p>“I was willing to let ya stay long enough to eat yer meal and so E here could have her say at ya. But now you’ve worn out yer welcome. This is the second time I’ve had to break Thelma out in the last ten years.” He holds the bat in front of him, both hands on the hilt and ready to swing. “And what really burns my britches is that both times it was because of you.” He brings the bat up over his shoulder. “Like I told ya last time, you mess with anyone in my restaurant, especially one of my girls, and I . . . mess . . . back!”</p>
                                    <p>This is the last time he ever gets served at Mac’s Diner.</p>
                                    <hr>
                                    <p>Two weeks later I receive a letter in the mail from a law firm in Houston, Texas. When I open the envelope I find a check made out to Connor and I in the amount of $500,000. There’s also a note in the envelope.</p>
                                    <span style="font-style:italic">
                                        <p>Dear Elizabeth,</p>
                                        <p>The enclosed check is every penny of my father’s life insurance policy and the cash value of everything that he’d left me in his will. He would have wanted you to have it. When I was at the diner two weeks ago, I didn’t get the chance to fully explain why it took me so long to come back. I told you that I’m sorry I wasn’t around for the last ten years and I know that this check doesn’t make up for anything that’s happened, but I hope that it’s at least a start. </p>
                                        <p>I said that I’ve changed, that I can be trusted, and I hope that one day you may come to see that. I know that I can never repair the damage I’ve done, but I pray that someday you will allow me the privilege of getting to know Your son, Connor. I really would like the honor of being a father to him, but I will not try to force that decision out of you. Liz, I have always loved you and I will continue to love you till the end of eternity. I don’t know what the future may hold for us, but please believe me when I say that I will never stop trying to regain your trust in me, no matter how long it takes.</p>
                                        <p>If you are open to the possibility of talking more, I am including my contact information here in Houston. There’s a ton of things I need to discuss with you about the last decade and about why I finally came back. I really hope that you call.</p>
                                        <p>Yours Always,<br>
                                        William</p>
                                    </span>
                                    <p>Finishing the letter, I crumple it into a ball and throw it across the room. I sit there in shock, wondering what has changed in him over the last ten years. This can’t all be just because of his dad’s death. While I’m curious about what’s caused this seemingly miraculous change of heart, I know that the last ten years can never be erased.</p>
                                    <p>But then I think . . .</p>
