									<p>If there is any one certainty within the transgender and gender non-conforming community, it is that there will most certainly be a lot of things that will change. Sometimes there will be miraculously happy life changing events such as taking your first dose of estrogen or testosterone, receiving your new birth certificate in the mail with your legally changed name and gender, or maybe even being given a date for one of the various gender confirmation/affirmation surgeries. Or maybe that change is the simple realization of what your gender identity is or the decision of what name you choose to match your gender identity.</p>
                                    <p>But sometimes, that change isn’t a happy one.</p>
                                    <p>One of the hardest changes we encounter most frequently as a community is that of relationships which change for the worse when we reveal our unique gender identity to those around us. Often there are a lot of tears, some yelling and name calling, and almost always there are broken hearts. There are three main categories of relationships where these heartbreaking changes are most frequently experienced: (1) Friends, (2) Family, and (3) Partners / Spouses.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">FRIENDS</h3>

                                    <p>For teens and young adults, a popular first option for who to come out to is those we consider friends. In many instances these are people that we have known for years, sometimes growing up through childhood together. These are people that we have shared some of our biggest struggles and secrets with.</p>
                                    <p>But what happens to that friendship when a friend reacts negatively to the news and realization of our true gender identity?</p>
                                    <p>In the best of worlds, there would be a conversation where the two friends discuss what being transgender means and what the newly revealed gender identity means to the friendship. Then after the conversation the two friends would keep being friends and the one’s gender identity would just become another beautiful aspect of their friendship. But, sadly, this isn’t always the case.</p>
                                    <p>Sometimes, because of religious views, political or social pressures, or even the possibility of personal misunderstandings, the revelation of a new gender identity can drive friends away. In many instances, this is a direct result of a lack of education about transgender individuals and the transgender community. The most challenging aspect of the revelation process is that some people, regardless of how good of friends they might have been, refuse to be educated on the subject. So, no matter how much we may want to salvage the friendship, it might now be unsalvageable.</p>
                                    <p>When friendships end, it can leave a mark. When friendships end because someone refuses to accept the gender identity of someone they once called friend, it can elicit a feeling of betrayal. For a transgender or gender non-conforming individual to open their heart to others and confide in them, it can feel like a big slap in the face out of nowhere. Opening up to someone about something so deeply personal takes a lot of courage.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/Transgender teen bullying.jpg" style="width:500px" alt="transgender teen girl being bullied">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>When that refusal to accept does happen, the trans* individual will typically go through a lot of different emotions. The range of emotions will differ from person to person, but may include: sadness, depression, anger (at the friend and at themselves), and even fear. This rejection can also foster within the trans* individual a sense of mistrust for others and can lead to what some may call a “loner” syndrome. An affected person could withdraw from the friendships that still remain and could in turn also start isolating themselves from the world around them. As hard as it was for the trans* person to open themselves up to friends the first time, it takes true strength and courage to attempt it again after being rejected. Every rejection thereafter hurts just that much more.</p>
                                    <p>But when the trans* person tells a friend about their gender identity and is wholeheartedly accepted for exactly who they are, it can have the potential to change the person’s entire outlook on life for the better. Memories of friends that are lost will hurt and there will be a lot of painful tears at times, but with the number of humans on this planet, it is almost a certainty that more friends will come along. No one will ever be able to replace that lost friend, but they will fill the void left by that friend. There are many wonderful people in this world who might be potential friends and many of those could potentially become the best friends that you will ever meet.</p>
                                    <p>From personal experience, I have lost more than a few friends over the years in large part because I am a transgender woman or because I had sunk into that “loner” syndrome and every one of those losses hurt. I didn’t find my first “real” friends until I was 39 or 40, and one of those friends that I found then just happened to be one of my best friends back in high school whom I had lost touch with for more than 20 years. Friends may come and go and come again, but – and this is for the friends and allies out there – the simple act of accepting someone for exactly who they are is powerful enough to change even the stormiest of days into one filled with rainbows and unicorns, metaphorically speaking.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">PARENTS & FAMILY</h3>

                                    <p>Like friends, our parents and families are many times the people who tend to know us best. In theory, we have known them since the day we were born, or the day they were born in the case of younger siblings. With all of that time getting to know someone, presumably years or even decades, one would think that they would know you best and love you unconditionally.</p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Yes, there are some amazing families out there, like my sister Angela (part of my tribe of amazingly wonderful friends) and her family who would do anything for her young transgender daughter and who is an amazing ally for the transgender community – you may have read an article by Angela in our November 2018 issue. But there are also a lot of families where acceptance and support are nowhere to be found.</p>
                                    <p>When a parent or family member rejects the declaration of our gender identity, it can feel like the ultimate betrayal of what family and unconditional love are supposed to mean. For those who come from a religious background, like I did – I was raised in the Southern Baptist church and my father was a youth minister for the first half of my childhood and a preacher for the second half – it can seem like they gave that betrayal an extra turn of the knife.</p>
                                    <p>Before I go any further, it is important to note that I refuse to speak ill of anyone’s religious beliefs. I personally do not attend church anymore due in large part to modern religious institutions’ corrupt and hypocritical practices and doctrines, especially in relation to the LGBTQIA+ community. I do, however, hold to my religious beliefs, most specifically the part that says “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you” (New Testament – John 15:12) and I do it unconditionally, with no strings attached, ever.</p>
                                    <p>When religion, politics, and other societal pressures tell your parents and or family to stop loving you unconditionally, it makes one begin to wonder if the loves was ever really there to begin with. Here’s a hint, the love was always there . . . the parent or family member just lost sight of their priorities in who should come first in their life.</p>
                                    <p>It is understandable that there may be some initial reluctance on the part of the parent or family member as the gender identity may have been presented to them very unexpectedly and they may not have any kind of understanding about it. Sometimes this may take a while to work through. But when that parent or family member absolutely refuses to accept the trans* person’s gender identity or offer any kind of support, the relationship will forever be damaged by that person’s religiously or socio-politically influenced preference for a chosen ignorance.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/Leelah Alcorn.jpg" style="width:500px" alt="image of transgender teen Leelah Alcorn">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>From my personal point of view, this is the hardest relationship to get past. After I came out as a transgender woman to my parents at the age of 39 (circa November 2014), my parents wouldn’t even talk to me for the better part of a year. My mother tried very briefly to carry on conversations, but they adamantly refused to learn anything about the real me or about the transgender community despite how much I offered. By the end of 2016, both of my parents, citing their religious beliefs as the reason, had disowned me because their religion, not the Word of God (i.e., the Holy Bible), became more important to them than their own daughter.</p>
                                    <p>Even though my parents have chosen to no longer be a part of my life, I still leave that door open for them with the hope that someday they might change their minds. I have shed more than a few tears over the loss of my relationship with my parents, but there have been a few silver linings that came after that. There is a variation of the old phrase that goes something like this: “When life closes one door, you can almost always find a window open somewhere.” For me, that window came in the form of me reconnecting with two cousins and an aunt that I hadn’t heard from in more than 30 years and my oldest friend in the world and her mother adopting me in love and acceptance.</p>
                                    <p>The loss of a familial relationship may very well be the hardest relationship to get over. You have spent numerous years and countless hours getting to know them and attempting to help them get to know you and that ultimate rejection may very well be a betrayal of everything that it means to be a family.</p>
                                    <p>A modern understanding of the word family truthfully prescribes that you may choose your own family from those you hold dear and they don’t necessarily have to be related to you by blood. Family can come in many different forms and one of the most comforting of those forms is the knowledge that, just in America alone, you have a family of more than 1.4 million brothers, sisters, elders, and youth who will love and support you through everything and that family is known as the transgender community. And as a transgender woman, I am so truly blessed and honored to be a part of your transgender family.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">PARTNERS & SPOUSES</h3>

                                    <p>Next to the loss of parental or familial relationships, the loss of partner/spouse relationships can be just as heartrending. While all friendships require an investment of both time and self, the level of investment required for a partner or spousal relationship is greatly increased. In order to even get to the marriage or civil union stage, for instance, requires large investments of time together getting to know each other and learning how to become a cohesive family unit.</p>
                                    <p>If you happen to be among the lucky individuals who met their partner or spouse after having transitioned or come out as trans*, you are among a very beautiful minority because your partner has only ever known you as being part of the transgender community. I met my current wife about a year after I transitioned, and yes, we have had our difficulties, but it has been a wonderful experience being in a relationship with someone who has only ever known me as being a transgender woman.</p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, a large majority of partner relationships aren’t lucky enough to start out that way. In some instances, the trans* partner in the relationship may not even fully realize that they are transgender or gender non-conforming until long after the relationship first began. In others, the trans* partner may spend years or even decades suppressing, for whatever reason, or attempting to hide the fact that they are trans*, typically for the purpose of either denying to themselves or the world around them that they are transgender or gender non-conforming.</p>
                                    <p>When the gender identity is finally revealed to the partner, it can oftentimes be a harrowing experience as the partner may have been completely unaware of any leanings towards a gender identity different from the one they started the relationship with. It is quite understandable that the partner may feel a sense of betrayal by their trans* partner. Some partners may even attempt to go along with it for a while, to kind of test the waters of possibility, as it were. Where for some couples this may become the start of a beautiful evolution in the relationship, for others it could be the beginning of the end of the relationship.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/What Sarah Lost.png" style="width:500px" alt="Sarah Flowers with ex-wife and 2 children">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>For the partner, the end of the relationship may be because they don’t want to be in a same sex relationship, possibly because of some religious or socio-political reason, or even because they realize they didn’t know and love their trans* partner as well as they thought they did and the revelation of the new gender identity could be just the excuse they were looking for to end the relationship. For the partner, the end may happen for any number of different reasons, or even a combination of reasons.</p>
                                    <p>But for the trans* partner, the end of the relationship could feel like a betrayal of the love and wedding vows that they had exchanged, specifically the part that says: “to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.” When the trans* partner comes out to their significant other it is our hope that nothing in the relationship will change. We have spent such a long time coming to an understanding of who we are as trans* individuals and the coming out process is our way of being honest with the partner that we love and cherish. Our coming out to our partner is our way of helping them to get to know us even better as part of building the relationship.</p>
                                    <p>When a relationship ends because one of the partners comes out as trans*, the trans* partner can quickly begin to feel as if their entire life has been turned upside down. The most difficult part of committed relationships that end is that many times there are also children involved which can certainly complicate things very quickly. To have everything we have loved and cherished and worked for ripped out from under us just because we were honest about who we are is a blow to the heart that not everyone can withstand.</p>
                                    <p>The loss of a committed partner, and possibly children as well, can be absolutely devastating. Aside from the obvious feelings that come with any terminated relationship, for the trans* individual this can also produce increased anxiety and depression about their gender identity, anger toward themselves and the partner, and fear about ever trusting anyone with their gender identity every again. And when children (of any age) are involved, the matter becomes even more complicated as they may become pawns or cannon fodder in the hurt feelings of the parents or they might be forced to choose between their parents if custody battles ensue.</p>
                                    <p>Dealing with those feelings once the dust settles is another challenge altogether. A moment ago I mentioned that my current relationship was one of the lucky ones. Unfortunately, it took three broken marriages and the loss of my children before I was lucky enough to find my forever love. While there were other matters that complicated those terminated relationships, the largest reason they ended was because I am transgender. And my second terminated marriage also included the loss of access to my children following a not-so-fun divorce and custody battle. Losing my wife was hard enough, but not being allowed to see my children for the past 11 years has caused a lot of depression and has led to many tear-filled nights.</p>
                                    <p>It took many years and a lot of courage to be able to come to terms with the emotions of those losses. After a lot of conversations with friends and my current wife, Amy, I have learned how to process those emotions. None of it was easy, but it can be done. In the end, I am a better woman for it and am once again able to open my heart to the love that I am able to share with Amy. And in hindsight, while I do still have a lot of painful memories from those three previous marriages, I bear no ill will towards the women I was married to. I know now that they were and are good women, I just wasn’t the person for them, even though I thought I was at the time, because I wasn’t able to be fully open and honest with them about who I am as a transgender woman.</p>
                                    <p>In the end, the loss of any relationship is never a fun prospect. But, it is how we deal with the loss that determines our future as trans* individuals. If you are experiencing any of the emotions that I have described, I encourage you to speak to a friend or family member or even a therapist or councilor. Don’t let those emotions fester and lead you to increased anxiety, depression, fear, anger, or even suicidal thoughts. Talk to someone and share your struggles. The Trans Lifeline and The Trevor Project are two great starting points and they are always available, night and day.</p>
                                    <p>And know that you are always welcome, loved, and forever supported in my family and within the transgender community.</p>
