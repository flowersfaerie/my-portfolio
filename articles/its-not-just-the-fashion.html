									<p>As transgender and non-binary individuals continue to fight tooth and nail for any semblance of respect and equality in this social/cultural/political/religious world, the one primary topic that everyone seems to focus on is that of gender identity. But our gender identity(ies) are just one single aspect of how we show the world who we truly are. How we express our individual gender identities, also known as gender expression, goes a long way toward not only helping others to understand who we are, but it also helps us to feel more comfortable in our own bodies. And for those who are just joining us, gender expression is something that everyone expresses, both cisgender and transgender individuals alike.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">GENDER EXPRESSION THROUGH FASHION</h3>
                                        
                                    <p>It’s pretty safe to say that one of the first things we notice about someone is the clothes that they wear. Some of the things we may notice are the type of clothing, colors, patterns, words, or pictures. We may also take notice of how the clothing items are tailored on a person: too tight, too loose, too long or short, and even how much it may or may not accentuate or highlight certain body features such as butts and breasts. The seemingly endless variations of possible clothing combinations are certainly enough to boggle the mind, but there is a lot more to fashion than just this.</p>
                                    <p>For reasons that most can’t even begin to understand, over the last several millennia humans have taken to attributing binary genders (male or female) to different clothing pieces. While clothing in and of itself doesn’t have gender or sexuality, certain types of clothing have become associated most commonly with specific genders (e.g., dresses and brassieres for women, suits and ties for men). The problem with attributing gender to specific clothing items is that it also forces a false stereotype on the person who is wearing it. For instance, if a woman wears a nice dress, she might incorrectly be considered sweet or perhaps classy; but if she wears a short skirt and a halter top, she might incorrectly be considered trashy, despite how hot it is outside.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/Carmen Carrera.jpg" alt="image of transgender model and activist Carmen Carrera">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>For trans* individuals, however, this forced gendering of clothing and fashion not only wrongly stereotypes a person, but it can also very quickly also become a double-edged sword. A trans* individual might be harshly criticized or stereotyped for wearing clothing of the opposite sex (in a strictly binary gendered world) and then also attacked (verbally and/or physically) if they don’t look enough like the gender that stereotypically might wear those clothes (i.e., transwomen in bikinis, and transmen in swim trunks and no shirt).</p>
                                    <p>Despite the false gendering of clothing and fashion, these garments also do a lot for expressing how a person feels about themselves and the world around them. Exactly like our cisgender counterparts, fashion and clothing choices can become an outward expression of how we feel about not only our bodies, but also how we feel emotionally about our lives and the world around us. Fashion is also chosen for specific occasions like swimsuits for the beach, shorts and tank tops for hot days, ball gowns and tuxedos for formal events, and even costumes for Halloween (note for all cisgender individuals: “transgender” is not a Halloween costume). The important thing to remember is that clothes are just clothes and do not have a gender, so wear whatever you feel comfortable wearing and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t wear it.</p>
                                        
                                    <h3 class="major">GENDER EXPRESSION THROUGH HAIR</h3>
                                        
                                    <p>Throughout history, both male and female identified individuals have changed the length and styles of their hair for numerous reason: cultural reasons, religious reasons, military reasons, as acts of rebellion, and even as a fashion statement. Over the course of those many years, certain hair lengths and styles have come to be more stereotypically associated with one gender or another. And along with those stereotypes have come society’s numerous gender enforcement rules. To make things even more complicated, these gendered hair lengths and styles tend to change periodically among different cultures, religions, ethnicities, and time periods.</p>
                                    <p>A few examples of some of the various hair-related gender expressions might include women having long hair as a sign of their assumed femininity and men having short hair as a sign of their readiness for battle (this stems from an Ancient Roman tradition), or men growing their hair long or styling it into a mohawk as a symbol of rebellion against social/cultural/political/religions oppressions and women cutting their hair short or even shaving their head as an act of rebellions against the stereotypical femininity that is forced upon them. These are just a few examples of how hair length and styles can play a major role in how binary male and female identified individuals may choose to express their gender identities.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/hair options.jpg" alt="illustration of various feminine hairstyles">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>For transgender individuals, this same need to express one’s self through various hair lengths and styles also exists. For cisgender individuals, these variations in hair-related gender expressions might be viewed as mostly normal and are generally understood to be expressions of not only an individual’s gender, but also expressions of their personal identities and beliefs. For trans* individuals, however, especially those who might be just beginning their gender transitions, some of these variations in hair length and style can quickly become hazardous to an individual’s life, income, social standings, and even family or friend relationships. For example, a transgender woman who is just beginning her transition may face ridicule from coworkers, family, and friends over her growing hair out and styling it in stereotypically female gendered styles; she might face condemnation or punishments from her employer for having hair that is too long or which is styled differently than what might stereotypically be deemed appropriate for a male (which she is not); or if she has successfully grown out her hair to a length she deems appropriate, but she hasn’t benefitted from much, or any, of the feminizing effects of estrogen (softening of the skin, breast development, redistribution of body fat, etc.), some ill-spirited individuals may falsely assume that she is just a male with long hair who is pretending to be a woman and may verbally and physically attack her because of it. (NOTE: transgender women are women and transgender men are men and non-binary gender individuals are the gender they say they are. There is no “pretending” to be that gender, they just are.)</p>
                                    <p>At the same time, and in direct contrast to the negative consequences of hair-related gender expressions for transgender individuals, there are also numerous benefits to being able to express ourselves through variations in our hair length and style. Among these benefits are the individual’s improved self-worth, their feeling that they more closely resemble others of their gender identity (as opposed to that of their assigned at birth gender), and their understanding that hair length and styles are only an expression of their gender identity and not a definition of that identity. As modern societies continue to evolve in their understanding of gender identity versus gender expression, the issue of cisgender and transgender individuals being pigeon-holed into a limited set of hair options based on binary gender stereotypes, we will begin to see a world where it is more common to regularly see men with long hair in revealing attire walking the runways during the Paris Fashion Week and women sporting crew-cuts and three-piece suits in the corporate boardroom.</p>
                                        
                                    <h3 class="major">GENDER EXPRESSION THROUGH VOICE</h3>
                                        
                                    <p>It’s not too surprising that when it comes to voice, there are more than just a few differences between binary male and female voices. If you have ever listened to a person singing, you will understand that most people have a range of different pitches that they can talk and sing at. For instance, men are typically thought of as having lower pitched voices, while woman are typically thought of as having higher pitched voices. One of the amazing things about the human voice is that it is capable of reaching both higher and lower pitches, the range of which depends on the speeds that an individual’s vocal chords are able to vibrate and how much that individual practices on expanding that range. Due to the vast range of possible vibration speeds, it is very common for some men to have higher voices to the point where they naturally sound more feminine in pitch (e.g., Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson, Adam Levine, and Prince) and for some women to have lower voices to the point where they naturally sound more masculine in pitch (e.g., Kathleen Turner, Demi Moore, Bea Arthur, and Geena Davis).</p>
                                    <p>When it comes to communication styles where the person’s voice is the only thing you know about them, that voice will often be the most unreliable factor when it comes to determining a person’s gender (as opposed to their gender identity). This unreliability as a gender identifier has the potential to operate as both a blessing and a curse for transgender individuals. However, with practice and working with a speech therapist, the curse side of the equation can be converted to a blessing. Under Resources on the Transgender Visibility & Education Network website (<a href="https://www.transgender.com/speech-therapy">https://www.transgenderven.com/speech-therapy</a>), we have several documents about speech therapy for transgender individuals and many practice exercises as well to help with expanding and refining your voice to the higher or lower pitch ranges that you may desire.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/The-Voice-Jordan-Gray.jpg" alt="image of transgender vocalist Jordan Gray from They Voice">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>As a transgender woman, I am not afraid to admit that I am just the slightest bit jealous of transgender men in that through their use of testosterone, they will naturally see some vocal modulation toward the masculine end of the spectrum; this is a typical effect of the use of testosterone. Transgender women, however, are not as lucky as the use of estrogen has absolutely no effect on the voice like testosterone does. While transgender men may need some speech therapy to help refine their vocal modulation, months or years of speech therapy is often the only option that many transgender women have for modulating their voices to a higher pitcher. Regrettably, until the testosterone or speech therapy have had a chance to make lasting changes, our assigned-at-birth gendered speaking voices may on occasion betray us to the wrong individuals, namely TERFs and the numerous transphobic individuals and groups around that tend to infest civilized societies.</p>
                                    <p>Like both fashion and hair, voice and vocal modulation have many benefits as well for transgender individuals. Not the least of which is the individual’s increased self-worth and self-assurance that their voice more closely matches their chosen and felt gender identity. But, as I mentioned above, the human voice is the most unreliable of gender identifies because of the vast range of vocal pitch and range possibilities that are possible within the human species. It is because of this that we are blessed with transgender men who can still sing a perfect “glass shattering” high C (Frequency: 2093.0 Hz) and talk like Minnie Mouse, and transgender women who can still easily reach a beautiful “earth rumbling” low C (Frequency: 32.703 Hz) and sound like James Earl Jones (a.k.a Darth Vader).</p>
                                    <p>And just like fashion and hair, our voices are merely an expression of our gender identities, but they in no way define who we are as transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. It is your life and your gender identity and it is my belief – and I hope that it is your belief as well – that we should be free to express our gender identities in any way that we may choose and with any means that we have at our disposal such as through fashion, hair lengths and styles, and through our uniquely beautiful voices.</p>
