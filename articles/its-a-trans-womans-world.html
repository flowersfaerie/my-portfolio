                                            “That looks nothing like a woman.”<br>
                                            “What is your REAL name? I mean the one you were given at birth?”<br>
                                            “Tranny.” “He-she.” “Shemale.”<br>

                                    <p>At one time or another, we have all heard many of the various transphobic and transmisogynistic slurs about transgender women. Some of you reading this may even have said some of these slurs at one time or another. While the words themselves can be extremely harmful to transgender woman, it is my belief, and the mission of the Transgender Visibility & Education Network, to educate those who may not currently know any better. In an effort to educate everyone and provide visibility for transgender women, I believe it would be most beneficial to offer an overview of what it means to be a transgender woman and some of the things that we struggle with every day.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Who Not What</h3>

                                    <p>Despite the insistence of many haters around the world (the words “Cheeto” and “45” come to mind) and their various henchpersons and subsidiaries, transgender individuals are very real and we have existed for thousands of years. While transgender individuals as an entire group are under attack, it has become more than obvious over the last several decades that transwomen face the bulk of these malicious psychological and physical attacks. But, while some of these attacks are born out of pure hatred of the “other,” many are simply the product of ignorance and miseducation.</p>
                                    <p>A transgender woman (transwoman) is an individual who was assigned the “male” sex designation (AMAB or DMAB) by doctors and society (parents included) based on a cursory visual examination of the genitals when a baby is born. This sex designation of a newborn does not take into consideration any intersex or chromosomal variations or an individual’s self-determined gender identity. A transwoman is a person who, while assigned male at birth (AMAB), identifies most closely with the feminine side of the gender spectrum; a transwoman is a woman, despite her genitalia or other secondary sex characteristics (e.g., breasts, voice, face and body hair, etc.). Gender identity is not limited to just male and female, but rather flows in both directions along a spectrum of more than [currently] 150 different gender identities from around the world.</p>
                                    <p>Even though it may seem more common for teenagers and young adults to announce their transwomanhood to the world, this self-determination as a transgender woman can occur at any age, both young and old. An individual’s gender identity cannot be determined by anyone other than that individual and it is their sole responsibility to determine their unique gender identity for them self. While there are various challenges to discovering and coming out as a transwoman at any age, there are also numerous blessings to doing so.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">A Place in This World</h3>

                                    <p>For far too long, transwomen have served as both the face of the transgender community and our community’s biggest punching bag. Beginning with Stonewall Inn Riots (Greenwich Village, New York; June 27, 1969; <a href="http://bit.ly/StonewallHeroines">http://bit.ly/StonewallHeroines</a>) transgender heroines like Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy and extending far beyond the last fifty years of LGBT+ Rights activism, transgender women have always been at the forefront of every battle (both victories and defeats) for the LGBT+ community’s rights and equalities. While some of us are honored and proud to stand up for and defend our sisters and our community, many more simply want to live their lives in peace and harmony. But the political battles aren’t the only challenges that transwomen face on a daily basis.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/johnson-and-rivera.jpg" style="width:500px" alt="Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera leading the march at Stonewall Riots">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>For teen and adolescent transgirls who choose to grace the world with their beautifully unique transness, life and growing up can feel like both a perfect diamond ready to be presented to the world after eons of crushing heat and pressure as well as like the fabled “No Man’s Land” of World War I where every inch of positive progress turns into another foot of progress lost. Young transgirls have many opportunities in regards to their futures that those who come out and or transition later in life are not afforded. One of these opportunities is being able to partake in puberty blockers (e.g. leuprorelin) which help to delay the development of secondary sex characteristics such facial hair, more masculine looking bodies, and deeper voices. Puberty blockers can also help provide for more time to develop a better understanding of the individual’s gender identity and allow for a smoother transition into an adult gender identity. At the same time, transgirls are at a higher risk of mental and physical health issues, abuse, bullying, assault, and suicide due to pressures and oppressions from other kids, bullies, religious organizations, political establishments, society as a whole, and even parents and other family members.</p>
                                    <p>For those who choose to share their amazingly wonderful transness with the world after having already grown into adulthood, it can quickly start to feel like there are more challenges than blessings. Between living and working as a gender that is not your own and having to secret away some of the best parts of yourself in order to avoid upsetting the lives of family, friends, partners, or children, the desire to and or act of coming out or transitioning can seem like both a nightmare and a dream. The thought of disrupting and altering someone’s long held understanding of who they perceived you to be is particularly scary especially because of the explosive potential for those relationships to end when a person comes out as transgender; far too many transgender children (both young and old) have been disowned by their parents simply for being transgender and numerous transgender parents have lost partners and children just for being transgender. But, even as terrifying as those possibilities can be, there are also a lot of wonderful possibilities as well, such as being able to finally live your true gender identity, to experience all of the beautiful fashion and cosmetic options, and to be able to finally show the world who you truly and wonderfully are.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Same !@#$, Different Day</h3>

                                    <p>Along with the rest of the transgender community, transwomen see numerous horrors and oppressions each and every day. As of November 20, 2018 (Transgender Day of Remembrance), there were 368 [known] transgender individuals around the world who lost their lives due to violent acts and a vast majority of them were transgender women; over three thousand (3,000) transgender individuals have been lost since the first Transgender Day of Remembrance in 2008. The number of transgender individuals who have been killed is a relatively easy thing to quantify as most murders are reported in the media and there are typically police records about them. But it is the number of everyday hardships we face that grow exponentially to the point where they couldn’t be counted even if we wanted to.</p>
                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="../images/articles/transgender-bathroom-2017-blog.png" style="max-width:1000px" alt="It wasn't about water fountains in the 60s, and its not about bathrooms today">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>Transgender girls and women frequently are forced to endure verbal abuses and assaults from both strangers and people they know. Physical assault is also a very common occurrence with approximately 47% of transgender individuals being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives – the highest percentage of these being in the Native American, Middle Eastern, and African American communities (2015 U.S. Transgender Survery, <a href="http://bit.ly/2015TransSurvey">http://bit.ly/2015TransSurvey</a>). Unfortunately, these verbal and physical assaults are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the oppression of the transgender community.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to the violent acts, we also face daily oppressions from those who would otherwise be considered our protectors. As I mentioned earlier, relationships are one form of oppression that we see most regularly wherein family or friends may put extremely harsh or strict limitations on their part of the relationship to the point where it may become easier and safer to just terminate the relation, regardless of how emotionally painful it may be. In most states in the U.S. and most countries around the world, there are no legal protections for transgender individuals so it is still very common for individuals to lose jobs, homes, healthcare, access to public facilities (especially bathrooms), and numerous other resources simply because we are transgender. And as has been witnessed most recently, these attacks aren’t always against an individual, but sometimes they are enacted against the entire transgender community all at the same time as in the case of thousands transgender women and men losing their careers and benefits in the U.S. military just because they are transgender and for no other reason (See our Letter to Transgender Service Members on page 17).</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">A Brighter Future</h3>

                                    <p>Even with all of the battles that we have to face on a daily basis – what I sometimes refer to as the Dark Trans-Ages – there are a lot of beautiful things, too. In many instances, when a birth family or childhood friend rejects a person for being transgender, this can often open up doors to new friendships or “chosen” families (a chosen family is a friendship that develops to a point where the person(s) feels more like a loving family member as opposed to just a friend). When the world feels totally against us, we start to realize that there are wonderful organizations like Transgender Visibility & Education Network, Trans Lifeline, the National Center for Transgender Equality, and the Trans Youth Equality Foundation who are working towards a better world for all transgender individuals. And we also discover that while the transgender community may be small in comparison to the rest of the human population, we have an extremely large community of family, friends, and allies who love us and support us without end. And one of the best things is that once an individual decides to embrace their transness, they instantly gain millions of trans-sisters, trans-brothers, and enby-siblings (enby = non-binary) who know what you are going through and will forever be a part of your family.</p>
                                    <p>So, as you continue to learn more about what it means to be transgender and a transwoman, we welcome you into our family. As you learn about the things that we face, please keep in mind the words that you say and how they can positively or negatively affect a transgender individual, even if you didn’t mean any harm in saying them. And please remember, “If you aren’t learning, you aren’t growing. So never lose your passion for being better than you were the day before.”</p>
