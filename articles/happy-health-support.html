										<p style="font-style:italic">“Nobody likes me, Everybody hate me,<br>
											Guess I’ll go eat worms . . .”</p>
											<p>- Guess I’ll Go Eat Worms (children’s song)</p>
									</div>
									
									<p>On the surface, this short children’s song seems very simplistic and juvenile. It evokes images of individuals who feel unloved and unwanted, who then make the decision to isolate themselves so they won’t get hurt by anyone. But the message in this simple song strikes a lot deeper and harder than it at first appears.</p>
									<p>At some point in our lives, each and every person throughout history has encountered moments (both short term and long term) where they have felt like the entire world was against them. This phenomenon is not a new concept. But over the last few decades, and more specifically, the last couple of years, this issue of feeling unloved and unwanted has really hit home within the transgender community.</p>
									<p>Since the 2016 Presidential election, members of the transgender community have both seen and experienced various examples of oppression, hatred, unacceptance, and violence; much of which has come from the government and the Presidency itself. Other sources of these oppressions and unacceptance may include, among many others, religious organizations, various cultural systems, employers, the medical community, friends, and even family members.</p>
									<p>Along with these oppressions and unacceptance we can be falsely tricked into believing that we as transgender and gender non-conforming individuals are somehow freaks or mutants or socially unclean. We can become convinced that we are completely unwanted and unlovable by those around us, even when logic and reason suggest otherwise, such as the relationship between a parent and child.</p>
									<p>It is extremely important to note that no matter how deeply ingrained some of these thoughts and beliefs may be, they are 100% wrong. Members of the transgender and gender non-conforming community are just as worthy of being loved and appreciated as everyone else. We, as both individuals and as a community, are just as capable (regardless of ability or disability) and valid as any cisgender individual, no matter what any person, government, law, religion, or cultural ideology may profess.</p>
									<p>The truly horribly part about being forced to endure these types of oppression and unacceptance is the incredible trauma that is inflicts on the receiver. The transphobias and transmisogynies that are forced on members of the transgender and gender non-conforming community lead not only to ostracization, abuse, and violence (to include sexual assault and murder), but they can also lead to the pervasive aggravation of various forms of mental illness. While violence of any kind that is directed at the transgender community or at individuals within the transgender community is absolutely reprehensible, they are more often than not short lived, even when they ultimately lead to the death of a member of our community. The aggravation of mental illnesses as direct result of these oppressions and unacceptance, however, can quickly become so pervasive that they haunt and traumatize a person for the rest of their lives and in some cases this can even lead to a person seeing no other escape from the pain other than suicide.</p>
									<p>As a transgender woman who has survived decades of mental and emotional abuse, to include transphobia and transmisogyny, who has survived nearly being murdered in the sixth grade, and who has survived nearly committing suicide, I want to assure you that while life may not always be easy or even safe, it will always get better. </p>
									<p>No matter where you are in life or in the world, I cannot encourage you enough to keep an open heart and know that there will always be someone out there who would love to hold your hand, give you their wings (listen to Rachel Platten’s songs “Stand By You” and “Better Place”), and go eat some yummy gummy worms with you. This person or persons might be a family member, a friend, a classmate, an organization like the Transgender Visibility & Education Network, or sometimes it might even be a completely random stranger. </p>
									<p>If you can’t readily think of a specific person that you can turn to for help, we suggest visiting your closest LGBTQIA+ Resource or Community Center or a nearby Gender Health Center. If you have access to one, talk to a therapist who has training in and or specializes in gender or transgender therapy. Your online friends via social media or even possibly some of your coworkers or classmates might be wonderful sources of support. The process of coming out as transgender or gender non-conforming is always a scary prospect and it is always made easier when we have someone who is already so very supportive to be there when we are able to find the courage to open the doors of that proverbial closet. </p>
									<p>If, however, you are unable to find someone whom you can trust with your heart, there are resources such as the Trans Lifeline, the Trevor Project, and the National Suicide Hotline who are always ready and waiting to talk to you and support you. And the best part is that these options are completely free and you will never have to worry about any oppression or unacceptance (especially with the Trans Lifeline) because they have been in your shoes and they are trained to be able to offer and recommend resources in your local area that can further help you in your times of need.</p>
									<p>The most important thing to remember is that there is always someone you can turn to for help. If you aren’t able to find the resources or sources of support that you need, I invite you to email me through the Transgender Visibility & Education Network at info@transgenderven.com. Legally, I must include that I am not a trained (or untrained) therapist or medical professional, but I would love to listen to your story as a loving and supportive friend. And if need be, I will research and suggest as many options as possible that are close to you where you can find the additional help you may need. But at the very least you will always have a loving and supporting friend and sister in me.</p>
