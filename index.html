											<h3 class="major">It's Not Just the Fashion</h3>
											<p>As transgender and non-binary individuals continue to fight tooth and nail for any semblance of respect and equality in this social/cultural/political/religious world, the one primary topic that everyone seems to focus on is that of gender identity. But our gender identity(ies) are just one single aspect of how we show the world who we truly are. How we express our individual gender identities, also known as gender expression, goes a long way toward not only helping others to understand who we are, but it also helps us to feel more comfortable in our own bodies. And for those who are just joining us, gender expression is something that everyone expresses, both cisgender and transgender individuals alike.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Happy, Healthy & Supported!</h3>
											<p>At some point in our lives, each and every person throughout history has encountered moments (both short term and long term) where they have felt like the entire world was against them. This phenomenon is not a new concept. But over the last few decades, and more specifically, the last couple of years, this issue of feeling unloved and unwanted has really hit home within the transgender community.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Growing Pains</h3>
											<p>If there is any one certainty within the transgender and gender non-conforming community, it is that there will most certainly be a lot of things that will change. Sometimes there will be miraculously happy life changing events such as taking your first dose of estrogen or testosterone, receiving your new birth certificate in the mail with your legally changed name and gender, or maybe even being given a date for one of the various gender confirmation/affirmation surgeries. Or maybe that change is the simple realization of what your gender identity is or the decision of what name you choose to match your gender identity.
												But sometimes, that change isnâ€™t a happy one.</p>

											<h3 class="major">It's a [Trans] Woman's World</h3>
											<p>At one time or another, we have all heard many of the various transphobic and transmisogynistic slurs about transgender women. Some of you reading this may even have said some of these slurs at one time or another. While the words themselves can be extremely harmful to transgender woman, it is my belief, and the mission of the Transgender Visibility & Education Network, to educate those who may not currently know any better. In an effort to educate everyone and provide visibility for transgender women, I believe it would be most beneficial to offer an overview of what it means to be a transgender woman and some of the things that we struggle with every day.</p>
